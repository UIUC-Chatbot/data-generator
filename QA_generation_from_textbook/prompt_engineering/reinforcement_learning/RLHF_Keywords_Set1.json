Computing relies on deterministic systems because computers operate based on instructions (called programs) that always produce the same output for a given input. This is important because it allows us to rely on the results of computations to be consistent and reproducible. Additionally, the concept of determinism is related to the idea of a universal computational device, which is a theoretical machine (like a Turing machine) that can perform any computation that can be computed.",

            "answers": [
                "Most keys on a keyboard are associated with more than one ASCII code because different combinations of keys can be used to produce different characters or symbols. For example, the letter \"E\" can be produced with the \"E\" key alone or by pressing the Shift key and the \"e\" key at the same time.",
                "Most keys are associated with more than one ASCII code because different keys can produce different characters depending on various factors such as the use of shift or control keys, or the language or keyboard layout being used.",
                "Most keys are associated with more than one ASCII code because they can produce different characters depending on the context or the software being used."

            "question": "Can you explain how input and output devices like keyboards and monitors use ASCII codes to display characters?",
            "answers": [
                "When a key is pressed on the keyboard, its corresponding ASCII code (which is an 8-bit binary code) is stored and made available to the computer. Each key is associated with multiple ASCII codes, with one code being generated when the Shift key is depressed and the other when it is not. The computer transfers the ASCII code to the electronics associated with the monitor which displays the corresponding character.",
                "ASCII codes are used to represent characters in computers. Input devices like keyboards use ASCII codes to encode the typed characters, and output devices like monitors use ASCII codes to decode and display the characters on the screen. The program in the given context uses ASCII codes to count the occurrences of a specific character in a file and convert the count into an ASCII code for display on the monitor.",
                "Input and output devices like keyboards and monitors use ASCII codes as a standardized method to represent characters in digital form. ASCII codes map each character to a unique numerical value, which allows devices to understand and display the character accordingly. In summary, the ASCII code system allows for consistent representation of characters across devices for efficient and accurate communication."
