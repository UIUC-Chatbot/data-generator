The coin\nthen rolls down a slope towards a gate controlled by a servo.  The gate\ncan be raised or lowered, and determines whether the coin exits from the\nother side or the bottom of the device.\n\nAs the coin rolls, it passes two optical sensors.{The full system\nactually allows four sensors to differentiate four types of coins, but\nour lab uses only two of these sensors.}  One of these sensors is \npositioned high enough above the slope that a dime passes beneath the\nsesnor, allowing the signal T produced by the sensor to tell us whether \nthe coin is a dime or a quarter.  The second sensor is positioned so\nthat all coins pass in front of it.  The sensor positions are chosen \ncarefully to ensure that, in the case of a quarter, the coin is still\nblocking the first sensor when it reaches the second sensor.  \nBlocked sensors give a signal of 1 in this design, so the rising edge \nthe signal from the second sensor can be used as a ``clock'' for our \nFSM.  When the rising edge occurs, the signal T from the first sensor \nindicates whether the coin is a quarter (T=1) or a dime (T=0).\n\n\nA sample timing diagram for the lab appears to the right.  The clock\nsignal generated by the lab is not only not a square wave---in other words,\nthe high and low portions are not equal---but is also unlikely to be periodic.\nInstead, the ``cycle'' is defined by the time between coin insertions.\nThe T signal serves as the single input to our FSM.  In the timing\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lab-timing.eps,width=2.55in}\n\n\ndiagram, T is shown as rising and falling before the clock edge.\nWe use positive edge-triggered flip-flops to implement our FSM,\nthus the aspect of the relative timing that matters to our design\nis that, when the clock rises, the value of T is stable and indicates \nthe type of coin entered.  The signal T may fall before or after\nthe clock does---the two are equivalent for our FSM's needs.\n\nThe signal A in the timing diagram is an output from the FSM, and\nindicates whether or not the coin should be accepted.  This signal \ncontrols the servo that drives the gate, and thus determines whether\nthe coin is accepted (A=1) as payment or rejected (A=0) and returned\nto the user.  \n\nLooking at the timing diagram, you should note that our FSM makes \na decision based on its current state and the input T and enters a \nnew state at the rising clock edge.  The value of A in the next cycle\nthus determines the position of the gate when the coin eventually\nrolls to the end of the slope.\n\nAs we said earlier, our FSM is thus a Moore machine: the output A\ndoes not depend on the input T, but only on the current internal \nstate bits of the the FSM.\n\nHowever, you should also now realize that making A depend on T\nis not adequate for this lab.  If A were to rise with T and\nfall with the rising clock edge (on entry to the next state), or\neven fall with the falling edge of T, the gate would return to the\nreject position by the time the coin reached the gate, regardless\nof our FSM's decision!\n\n",

Outputs are calculated for each state in order to understand how stoplight sequencing works, controlling lights with equations derived from connections between components. Finally, F is used to set the timer when necessary outside of regular transitions in order to maintain desired states for some number of cycles.",
                " A digital FSM is used to control the stoplights at an intersection by taking two inputs, V^ and V^, which sense vehicles approaching from either direction on one of the two roads, and three additional inputs A, B, and C that control the timing behavior of the system. The outputs of the controller consist of two 2-bit values L^ and L^ which specify the light colors for each road."

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Design of a Vending Machine}\n\nFor the next example, we design an FSM to control a simple vending machine.  \nThe machine accepts {U.S. coins}{Most countries have small \nbills or coins in demoninations suitable for vending machine prices, so think \nabout some other currency if you prefer.} as payment and offers a choice\nof three items for sale.\n\nWhat states does such an FSM need?  The FSM needs to keep track of how\nmuch money has been inserted in order to decide whether a user can \npurchase one of the items.  That information alone is enough for the\nsimplest machine, but let's create a machine with adjustable item\nprices.  We can use registers to hold the item prices, which \nwe denote P_1, P_2, and P_3.\n\nTechnically, the item prices are also part of the internal state of the \nFSM.  However,  we leave out discussion (and, indeed, methods) for setting\nthe item prices, so no state with a given combination of prices has any \ntransition to a state with a different set of item prices.\nIn other words, any given combination of item prices induces a subset \nof states that operate independently of the subset induced by a distinct \ncombination of item prices.  By abstracting away the prices in this way,\nwe can focus on a general design that allows the owner of the machine\nto set the prices dynamically.\n\n\nOur machine will not accept pennies, so let's have the FSM keep track of\nhow much money has been inserted as a multiple of 5 cents (one nickel).\nThe table to the right shows five types of coins, their value in \ndollars, and their value in terms of nickels.\n\nThe most expensive item in the machine might cost a dollar or two, so\nthe FSM must track at least 20 or 40 nickels of value.  Let's\n\n\n{l|c|c}\n{c|}{coin type}& value& # of nickels \nnickel&      0.05& 1\ndime&        0.10& 2\nquarter&     0.25& 5\nhalf dollar& 0.50& 10\ndollar&      1.00& 20\n\n\n\ndecide to\nuse six bits to record the number of nickels, which allows the machine\nto keep track of up to 3.15 (63 nickels).  We call the abstract\nstates { STATE00} through { STATE63}, and refer to a state with\nan inserted value of N nickels as { STATE{<}N{>}}.\n\nLet's now create a next-state table, as shown at the top of the next page.\nThe user can insert one of the five coin types, or can pick one of the \nthree items.  What should happen if the user inserts more money than the \nFSM can track?  Let's make the FSM reject such coins.  Similarly, if the \nuser tries to buy an item without inserting enough money first, the FSM \nmust reject the request.  For each of the possible input events, we add a \ncondition to separate the FSM states that allow the input event to \nbe processed as the user desires from those states that do not.  For example,\nif the user inserts a quarter, those states with N<59 transition to\nstates with value N+5 and accept the quarter.  Those states with\nN reject the coin and remain in { STATE{<}N{>}}.\n\n\n{c|l|c|l|c|c}\n&&& {|c}{final state}\n&&& {|c}{}& & release \ninitial state& {|c|}{input event}& condition& {|c}& & product \n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& no input& always& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& nickel inserted& N<63& { STATE{<}N+1{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& nickel inserted& N=63& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dime inserted& N<62& { STATE{<}N+2{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dime inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& quarter inserted& N<59& { STATE{<}N+5{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& quarter inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& half dollar inserted& N<54& { STATE{<}N+10{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& half dollar inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dollar inserted& N<44& { STATE{<}N+20{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dollar inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 1 selected& N{P_1}& { STATE{<}N-P_1{>}}& ---& 1\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 1 selected& N<P_1& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 2 selected& N{P_2}& { STATE{<}N-P_2{>}}& ---& 2\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 2 selected& N<P_2& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 3 selected& N{P_3}& { STATE{<}N-P_3{>}}& ---& 3\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 3 selected& N<P_3& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n\n\n\nWe can now begin to formalize the I/O for our machine.  Inputs include \ninsertion of coins and selection of items for purchase.  Outputs include\na signal to accept or reject an inserted coin as well as signals to release\neach of the three items.\n\n\nFor input to the FSM, we assume that a coin inserted in any given cycle \nis classified and delivered to our FSM using the three-bit representation \nshown to the right.\n\nFor item selection, we assume that the user has access to three buttons,\nB_1, B_2, and B_3, that indicate a desire to purchase the \ncorresponding item.\n\nFor output, the FSM must produce a signal A indicating whether a coin\nshould be accepted.  To control the release of items that have been purchased,\nthe FSM must produce the signals R_1, R_2, and R_3, corresponding\nto the re-\n\n\n{l|c}\n{c|}{coin type}& C_2C_1C_0 \nnone&        110\nnickel&      010\ndime&        000\nquarter&     011\nhalf dollar& 001\ndollar&      111\n\n\n\nlease of each item.  Since outputs in our class depend only on\nstate, we extend the internal state of the FSM to include bits for each of\nthese output signals.  The output signals go high in the cycle after\nthe inputs that generate them.  Thus, for example, the accept signal A\ncorresponds to a coin inserted in the previous cycle, even if a second\ncoin is inserted in the current cycle.  This meaning must be made clear to\nwhomever builds the mechanical system to return coins.\n\nNow we are ready to complete the specification.  How many states does the\nFSM have?  With six bits to record money inserted and four bits to \ndrive output signals, we have a total of 1,024 (2^) states!\nSix different coin inputs are possible, and the selection buttons allow\neight possible combinations, giving 48 transitions from each state.\nFortunately, we can use the meaning of the bits to greatly simplify\nour analysis.\n\nFirst, note that the current state of the coin accept bit and item\nrelease bits---the four bits of FSM state that control the outputs---have\nno effect on the next state of the FSM.  Thus, we can consider only the\ncurrent amount of money in a given state when thinking about the \ntransitions from the state.  As you have seen, we can further abstract\nthe states using the number N, the number of nickels currently held by \nthe vending machine.\n\nWe must still consider all 48 possible transitions from { STATE{<}N{>}}.\nLooking back at our abstract next-state table, notice that we had only\neight types of input events (not counting ``no input'').  If we\nstrictly prioritize these eight possible events, we can safely ignore\ncombinations.  Recall that we adopted a similar strategy for several \nearlier designs, including the ice cream dispenser in Notes Set 2.2 and\nthe keyless entry system developed in Notes Set 3.1.3.\n\nWe choose to prioritize purchases over new coin insertions, and to \nprioritize item 3 over item 2 over item 1.  These prioritizations\nare strict in the sense that if the user presses B_3, both other\nbuttons are ignored, and any coin inserted is rejected, regardless of\nwhether or not the user can actually purchase item 3 (the machine\nmay not contain enough money to cover the item price).\n\nWith the choice of strict prioritization, all transitions from all\nstates become well-defined.  We apply the transition rules in order of\ndecreasing priority,\nwith conditions, and with {don't-cares} for lower-priority inputs. \nFor example, for any of the 16 { STATE50}'s (remember that the four\ncurrent output bits do not affect transitions), the table below lists all\npossible transitions assuming that P_3=60, P_2=10, and P_1=35.\n\n{\n{ccccc|ccccc}\n&&&&& {|c}{next state}\ninitial state& B_3& B_2& B_1& C_2C_1C_0& state& A& R_3& R_2& R_1 \n{ STATE50}& 1&x&x& xxx& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&1&x& xxx& { STATE40}& 0& 0&1&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&1& xxx& { STATE15}& 0& 0&0&1\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 010& { STATE51}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 000& { STATE52}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 011& { STATE55}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 001& { STATE60}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 111& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 110& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n\n}\nNext, we need to choose a state representation.  But this task is \nessentially done: each output bit (A, R_1, R_2, and R_3) is\nrepresented with one bit in the internal representation, and the\nremaining six bits record the number of nickels held by the vending\nmachine using an unsigned representation.\n\nThe choice of a numeric representation for the money held is important,\nas it allows us to use an adder to compute the money held in\nthe next state.\n\n",

A \ndecoder takes an input signal---typically one coded as a binary number---and \nproduces one output for each possible value of the signal.  You may\nnotice the similarity with the structure of a mux: when the decoder\nis enabled (EN=1), each of the AND gates produces\n\n\n\n\n\none minterm of the input signal S.  In\nthe mux, each of the inputs is then included in\none minterm's AND gate, and the outputs of all AND gates are ORd together.\nIn the decoder, the AND gate outputs are the outputs of the decoder.\nThus, when enabled, the decoder produces exactly one 1 bit on its outputs.\nWhen not enabled (EN=0), the decoder produces all 0 bits.\n\nWe use a decoder to generate the release signals for the vending machine\nby connecting the signal S produced by the \npriority encoder to the decoder's S input and connecting the item\nrelease signal R to the decoder's EN input.  The outputs D_1,\nD_2, and D_3 then correspond to the individual item release \nsignals R_1, R_2, and R_3 for our vending machine.\n\n",

A truth table for our priority encoder appears on the \nleft below, with {K-maps} for each of the output bits on the right.\n\n\n{cccc|cc}\nB_3& B_2& B_1& B_0& P& S \n1&x&x&x& 1& 11\n0&1&x&x& 1& 10\n0&0&1&x& 1& 01\n0&0&0&1& 1& 00\n0&0&0&0& 0& xx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the {K-maps}, we extract the following equations:\n{eqnarray*}\nP &=& B_3 + B_2 + B_1 + B_0\nS_1 &=& B_3 + B_2\nS_0 &=& B_3 + {B_2}B_1\n{eqnarray*}\nwhich allow us to implement our encoder as shown to the right.\n\nIf we connect our buttons B_1, B_2, and B_3 to the priority \nencoder (and feed 0 into the fourth input), it produces a signal P \nindicating that the user is trying to make a purchase and a two-bit\nsignal S indicating which item the user wants.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to build logic to control the item release outputs R_1, R_2,\nand R_3.  An item should be released only when it has been selected \n(as indicated by the priority encoder signal S) and the vending machine\nhas enough money.  For now, let's leave aside calculation of the item \nrelease signal, which we call R, and focus on how we can produce the\ncorrect values of R_1, R_2, and R_3 from S and R.\n\nThe component to the right is a { decoder} with an enable input.  A \ndecoder takes an input signal---typically one coded as a binary number---and \nproduces one output for each possible value of the signal.  You may\nnotice the similarity with the structure of a mux: when the decoder\nis enabled (EN=1), each of the AND gates produces\n\n\n\n\n\none minterm of the input signal S.  In\nthe mux, each of the inputs is then included in\none minterm's AND gate, and the outputs of all AND gates are ORd together.\nIn the decoder, the AND gate outputs are the outputs of the decoder.\nThus, when enabled, the decoder produces exactly one 1 bit on its outputs.\nWhen not enabled (EN=0), the decoder produces all 0 bits.\n\nWe use a decoder to generate the release signals for the vending machine\nby connecting the signal S produced by the \npriority encoder to the decoder's S input and connecting the item\nrelease signal R to the decoder's EN input.  The outputs D_1,\nD_2, and D_3 then correspond to the individual item release \nsignals R_1, R_2, and R_3 for our vending machine.\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Design of a Game Controller}\n\nFor the next example, imagine that you are part of a team building a\ngame for children to play at Engineering Open House.\n\nThe game revolves around an old logic problem in which a farmer must\ncross a river in order to reach the market.  The farmer is traveling\nto the market to sell a fox, a goose, and some corn.  The farmer has\na boat, but the boat is only large enough to carry the fox, the goose,\nor the corn along with the farmer.  The farmer knows that if he leaves\nthe fox alone with the goose, the fox will eat the goose.  Similarly,\nif the farmer leaves the goose alone with the corn, the goose will \neat the corn.\n\nHow can the farmer cross the river?\n\nYour team decides to build a board illustrating the problem with\na river from top to bottom and lights illustrating the positions of \nthe farmer (always with the boat), the fox, the goose, and the\ncorn on either the left bank or the right bank of the river.\nEverything starts on the left bank, and the children can play \nthe game until they win by getting everything to the right bank or\nuntil they make a mistake.\n\nAs the ECE major on your team, you get to design the FSM!\n\n{choose a state representation}{step-repn}\n{calculate logic expressions}{step-logic}\n{implement with flip-flops and gates}{step-gates}\n\nSince the four entities (farmer, fox, goose, and corn) can be only\non one bank or the other, we can use one bit to represent the location\nof each entity.  Rather than giving the states names, let's just\ncall a state FXGC.  The value of F represents the location of the farmer,\neither on the left bank (F=0) or the right bank (F=1).  Using\nthe same representation (0 for the left bank, 1 for the right bank),\nthe value of X represents the location of the fox, G represents the\nlocation of the goose, and C represents the location of the corn.\n\n\nWe can now put together an abstract next-state table, as shown to\nthe right.  Once the player wins or loses, let's have the game indicate\ntheir final status and stop accepting requests to have the farmer cross\nthe river.  We can use a reset button to force the game back into the\noriginal state for the next player.\n\nNote that we have included conditions for some of the input events, as \nwe did previously\n\n\n{c|l|c|c}\ninitial state& {|c|}{input event}& condition& final state \nFXGC& no input& always& FXGC\nFXGC& reset & always& 0000\nFXGC& cross alone& always& XGC\nFXGC& cross with fox& F=X& GC\nFXGC& cross with goose& F=G& XC\nFXGC& cross with corn& F=C& XG\n\n\n\nwith the vending machine design.\n\nThe conditions here require that the farmer be on the same bank as any\nentity that the player wants the farmer to carry across the river.\n\nNext, we specify the I/O interface. \n\nFor input, the game has five buttons.  A reset button R forces the\nFSM back into the initial state.  The other four buttons cause the\nfarmer to cross the river: B_F crosses alone, B_X with the fox,\nB_G with the goose, and B_C with the corn.\n\nFor output, we need position indicators for the four entities, but let's\nassume that we can simply output the current state FXGC and have\nappropriate images or lights appear on the correct banks of the \nriver.  We also need two more indicators: W for reaching the winning\nstate, and L for reaching a losing state.\n\nNow we are ready to complete the specification.  We could use a strict\nprioritization of input events, as we did with earlier examples.  Instead,\nin order to vary the designs a bit, we use a strict prioritization among \nallowed inputs.  The reset button R has the highest priority, followed\nby B_F, B_C, B_G, and finally B_X.  However, only those buttons \nthat result in an allowed move are considered when selecting one button \namong several pressed in a single clock cycle.\n\n\nAs an example, consider the \nstate FXGC=0101.  The farmer is not on the same bank as the fox, nor\nas the corn, so the B_X and B_C buttons are ignored, leading to the\nnext-state table to the right.  Notice that B_G is accepted even if B_C\nis pressed because the farmer is not on the same\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0101& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0101& 0& 1& x& x& x& 1101\n0101& 0& 0& x& 1& x& 1111\n0101& 0& 0& x& 0& x& 0101\n\n\n\nbank as the corn.\nAs shown later, this approach to prioritization\nof inputs is equally simple in terms of implementation.  \n\n\nRecall that we want to stop the game when the player wins or loses.\nIn these states, only the reset button is accepted.  For example, the \nstate FXGC=0110 is a losing state because\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0110& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0110& 0& x& x& x& x& 0110\n\n\n\nthe farmer\nhas left the fox with the goose on the opposite side of the river.\nIn this case, the player can reset the game, but other buttons\nare ignored.\n\nAs we have already chosen a representation, we now move on to implement\nthe FSM.  Let's begin by calculating the next state ignoring the\nreset button and the winning and losing states, as shown in the logic \ndiagram below.\n\n\n\nThe left column of XOR gates determines whether the farmer is on the same\nbank as the corn (top gate), goose (middle gate), and fox (bottom gate).\nThe output of each gate is then used to mask out the corresponding button:\nonly when the farmer is on the same bank are these buttons considered.\nThe adjusted button values are then fed into a priority encoder, which\nselects the highest priority input event according to the scheme that\nwe outlined earlier (from highest to lowest, B_F, B_C, B_G, and\nB_X, ignoring the reset button).  \n\nThe output of the priority encoder is then used to drive another column\nof XOR gates on the right in order to calculate the next state.\nIf any of the allowed buttons is pressed, the priority encoder \noutputs P=1, and the farmer's bank is changed.  If B_C is allowed\nand selected by the priority encoder (only when B_F is not pressed),\nboth the farmer and the corn's banks are flipped.  The goose and the fox\nare handled in the same way.\n\n\nNext, let's build a component to produce the win and lose signals.\nThe one winning state is FXGC=1111, so we simply need an AND gate.\nFor the lose signal L, we can fill in a {K-map} and derive an \nexpression, as shown to the right, then implement as shown in the logic\ndiagram to the far right.  For the {K-map}, remember that the player\nloses whenever the fox and the goose are on the same side of the river,\nbut opposite from the farmer, or whenever the goose and the corn are on\nthe same side of the river, but opposite from the farmer.\n\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\nL &=& F   +  X G +\n&& F   +  G C\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we complete our design by integrating the next-state\ncalculation and the win-lose calculation with a couple of muxes, as\nshown to the right.\n\nThe lower mux controls the final value of the next state: note that\nit selects between the constant state FXGC=0000 when the reset button R\nis pressed and the output of the upper mux when R=0.\n\nThe upper mux is controlled by W+L, and retains the current state\nwhenever either signal is 1.  In other words, once the player has won\nor lost, the upper mux prevents further state changes until the reset\nbutton is pressed.\n\nWhen R, W, and L are all 0, the next state is calculated\naccording to whatever buttons have been pressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Similarly,\nif the farmer leaves the goose alone with the corn, the goose will \neat the corn.\n\nHow can the farmer cross the river?\n\nYour team decides to build a board illustrating the problem with\na river from top to bottom and lights illustrating the positions of \nthe farmer (always with the boat), the fox, the goose, and the\ncorn on either the left bank or the right bank of the river.\nEverything starts on the left bank, and the children can play \nthe game until they win by getting everything to the right bank or\nuntil they make a mistake.\n\nAs the ECE major on your team, you get to design the FSM!\n\n{choose a state representation}{step-repn}\n{calculate logic expressions}{step-logic}\n{implement with flip-flops and gates}{step-gates}\n\nSince the four entities (farmer, fox, goose, and corn) can be only\non one bank or the other, we can use one bit to represent the location\nof each entity.  Rather than giving the states names, let's just\ncall a state FXGC.  The value of F represents the location of the farmer,\neither on the left bank (F=0) or the right bank (F=1).  Using\nthe same representation (0 for the left bank, 1 for the right bank),\nthe value of X represents the location of the fox, G represents the\nlocation of the goose, and C represents the location of the corn.\n\n\nWe can now put together an abstract next-state table, as shown to\nthe right.  Once the player wins or loses, let's have the game indicate\ntheir final status and stop accepting requests to have the farmer cross\nthe river.  We can use a reset button to force the game back into the\noriginal state for the next player.\n\nNote that we have included conditions for some of the input events, as \nwe did previously\n\n\n{c|l|c|c}\ninitial state& {|c|}{input event}& condition& final state \nFXGC& no input& always& FXGC\nFXGC& reset & always& 0000\nFXGC& cross alone& always& XGC\nFXGC& cross with fox& F=X& GC\nFXGC& cross with goose& F=G& XC\nFXGC& cross with corn& F=C& XG\n\n\n\nwith the vending machine design.\n\nThe conditions here require that the farmer be on the same bank as any\nentity that the player wants the farmer to carry across the river.\n\nNext, we specify the I/O interface. \n\nFor input, the game has five buttons.  A reset button R forces the\nFSM back into the initial state.  The other four buttons cause the\nfarmer to cross the river: B_F crosses alone, B_X with the fox,\nB_G with the goose, and B_C with the corn.\n\nFor output, we need position indicators for the four entities, but let's\nassume that we can simply output the current state FXGC and have\nappropriate images or lights appear on the correct banks of the \nriver.  We also need two more indicators: W for reaching the winning\nstate, and L for reaching a losing state.\n\nNow we are ready to complete the specification.  We could use a strict\nprioritization of input events, as we did with earlier examples.  Instead,\nin order to vary the designs a bit, we use a strict prioritization among \nallowed inputs.  The reset button R has the highest priority, followed\nby B_F, B_C, B_G, and finally B_X.  However, only those buttons \nthat result in an allowed move are considered when selecting one button \namong several pressed in a single clock cycle.\n\n\nAs an example, consider the \nstate FXGC=0101.  The farmer is not on the same bank as the fox, nor\nas the corn, so the B_X and B_C buttons are ignored, leading to the\nnext-state table to the right.  Notice that B_G is accepted even if B_C\nis pressed because the farmer is not on the same\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0101& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0101& 0& 1& x& x& x& 1101\n0101& 0& 0& x& 1& x& 1111\n0101& 0& 0& x& 0& x& 0101\n\n\n\nbank as the corn.\nAs shown later, this approach to prioritization\nof inputs is equally simple in terms of implementation.  \n\n\nRecall that we want to stop the game when the player wins or loses.\nIn these states, only the reset button is accepted.  For example, the \nstate FXGC=0110 is a losing state because\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0110& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0110& 0& x& x& x& x& 0110\n\n\n\nthe farmer\nhas left the fox with the goose on the opposite side of the river.\nIn this case, the player can reset the game, but other buttons\nare ignored.\n\nAs we have already chosen a representation, we now move on to implement\nthe FSM.  Let's begin by calculating the next state ignoring the\nreset button and the winning and losing states, as shown in the logic \ndiagram below.\n\n\n\nThe left column of XOR gates determines whether the farmer is on the same\nbank as the corn (top gate), goose (middle gate), and fox (bottom gate).\nThe output of each gate is then used to mask out the corresponding button:\nonly when the farmer is on the same bank are these buttons considered.\nThe adjusted button values are then fed into a priority encoder, which\nselects the highest priority input event according to the scheme that\nwe outlined earlier (from highest to lowest, B_F, B_C, B_G, and\nB_X, ignoring the reset button).  \n\nThe output of the priority encoder is then used to drive another column\nof XOR gates on the right in order to calculate the next state.\nIf any of the allowed buttons is pressed, the priority encoder \noutputs P=1, and the farmer's bank is changed.  If B_C is allowed\nand selected by the priority encoder (only when B_F is not pressed),\nboth the farmer and the corn's banks are flipped.  The goose and the fox\nare handled in the same way.\n\n\nNext, let's build a component to produce the win and lose signals.\nThe one winning state is FXGC=1111, so we simply need an AND gate.\nFor the lose signal L, we can fill in a {K-map} and derive an \nexpression, as shown to the right, then implement as shown in the logic\ndiagram to the far right.  For the {K-map}, remember that the player\nloses whenever the fox and the goose are on the same side of the river,\nbut opposite from the farmer, or whenever the goose and the corn are on\nthe same side of the river, but opposite from the farmer.\n\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\nL &=& F   +  X G +\n&& F   +  G C\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we complete our design by integrating the next-state\ncalculation and the win-lose calculation with a couple of muxes, as\nshown to the right.\n\nThe lower mux controls the final value of the next state: note that\nit selects between the constant state FXGC=0000 when the reset button R\nis pressed and the output of the upper mux when R=0.\n\nThe upper mux is controlled by W+L, and retains the current state\nwhenever either signal is 1.  In other words, once the player has won\nor lost, the upper mux prevents further state changes until the reset\nbutton is pressed.\n\nWhen R, W, and L are all 0, the next state is calculated\naccording to whatever buttons have been pressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For naming purposes, we assume that one\nof the roads runs East and West (EW), and the second runs North and \nSouth (NS).  \n\nThe stoplight controller has two inputs, each of which \nsenses vehicles approaching from either direction on one of the two roads.\nThe input V^=1 when a vehicle approaches from either the East or the\nWest, and the input V^=1 when a vehicle approaches from either the\nNorth or the South.  These inputs are also active when vehicles are stopped\nwaiting at the corresponding lights.\n\nAnother three inputs, A, B, and C, control the timing behavior of the\nsystem; we do not discuss them here except as variables.\n\n\nThe outputs of the controller consist of two {2-bit} values, \nL^ and L^, that specify the light colors for the two roads.\nIn particular, L^ controls the lights facing East and West, and\nL^ controls the lights facing North and South.  The meaning of these\noutputs is given in the table to the right.\n\n\n{c|c}\nL& light color \n0x& red\n10& yellow\n11& green\n\n\n\nLet's think about the basic operation of the controller.\n\nFor safety reasons, the controller must ensure that the lights on one\nor both roads are red at all times.  \n\nSimilarly, if a road has a green light, the controller should \nshow a yellow light before showing a red light to give drivers some\nwarning and allow them to slow down.\n\nFinally, for fairness, the controller should alternate green lights\nbetween the two roads.\n\nNow take a look at the logic diagram below.\n\nThe state of the FSM has been split into two pieces: a {3-bit} \nregister S and a {6-bit} timer.  The timer is simply a binary \ncounter that counts downward and produces an output of Z=1 when it \nreaches 0.  Notice that the register S only takes a new value\nwhen the timer reaches 0, and that the Z signal from the timer\nalso forces a new value to be loaded into the timer in the next \ncycle.  We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by \ncycle basis as consisting of two types.  The first type simply\ncounts downward for a number of cycles while holding the register S\nconstant, while the second changes the value of S and sets the\ntimer in order to maintain the new value of S \nfor some number of cycles.\n\n\n\n3.45\n\n\nLet's look at the next-state logic for S, which feeds into the IN\ninputs on the {3-bit} register (S_2^+=IN_2 and so forth).  Notice \nthat none of the inputs to the FSM directly affect these values.  The\nstates of S thus act like a counter.  By examining the connections,\nwe can derive equations for the next state and draw a transition\ndiagram, as shown to the right.\n\nAs the figure shows, there are six states in the loop defined by the \nnext-state logic, with the two remaining states converging into the\nloop after a single cycle.\n\nLet's now examine the outputs for each\nstate in order to understand how the stoplight sequencing\nworks.\n\nWe derive equations for the outputs that control the lights, as shown\nto the right, then calculate values and colors for each\nstate, as shown to the far right.  For completeness, the table \nincludes the states outside of the desired loop.  The \nlights are all red in both of these states, which is necessary for safety.\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n\nS_2^+ &=& {S_2} + S_0\nS_1^+ &=& {S_2}  S_1\nS_0^+ &=& {S_2}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n{eqnarray*}\nL_1^ &=& S_2 S_1\nL_0^ &=& S_0\nL_1^ &=& S_2 {S_1}\nL_0^ &=& S_0\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n{c|cc|cc}\n&&& EW& NS\n&&& light& light\nS& L^& L^& color& color \n000& 00& 00&    red&    red\n111& 11& 01&  green&    red\n110& 10& 00& yellow&    red\n010& 00& 00&    red&    red\n101& 01& 11&    red&  green\n100& 00& 10&    red& yellow \n001& 01& 01&    red&    red\n011& 01& 01&    red&    red\n\n\n\n\nNow let's think about how the timer works.  As we already noted, the\ntimer value is set whenever S enters a new state, but it can also be\nset under other conditions---in particular, by the signal F calculated\nat the bottom of the FSM logic diagram.  \n\n\nFor now, assume that F=0.  In this case, the timer is set only when\nthe state S changes, and we can find the duration of each state by\nanalyzing the muxes.  The bottom mux selects A when S_2=0, and \nselects the output of the top mux when S_2=1.  The top mux selects B\nwhen S_0=1, and selects C when S_0=0.  Combining these results,\nwe can calculate the duration of the next states of S when F=0, \nas shown in the table to the right.  We can then combine the next\nstate duration with our previous calculation of the state sequencing \n(also the order in the table) to obtain the durations of each state, also\nshown in the rightmost column of the table.\n\n\n{c|cc|cc}\n& EW& NS& next& current\n& light& light& state& state\nS& color& color& duration& duration \n000&    red&    red& A& C\n111&  green&    red& B& A\n110& yellow&    red& C& B\n010&    red&    red& A& C\n101&    red&  green& B& A\n100&    red& yellow& C& B \n001&    red&    red& A& ---\n011&    red&    red& A& ---\n\n\n\nWhat does F do?  Analyzing the gates that produce it gives \nF=S_1S_0{V^+{S_1}S_0{V^.  If we \nignore the two states outside of the main loop for S, the first term \nis 1 only when the lights are green on the East and West roads and the \ndetector for the North and South roads indicates that no vehicles are \napproaching.  Similarly, the second term is 1 only when the lights are \ngreen on the North and South roads and the detector for the East and \nWest roads indicates that no vehicles are approaching.\n\nWhat happens when F=1?  First, the OR gate feeding into the timer's\nLD input produces a 1, meaning that the timer loads a new value\ninstead of counting down.  Second, the OR gate controlling the lower\nmux selects the A input.  In other words, the timer is reset to A\ncycles, corresponding to the initial value for the green light states.\nIn other words, the light stays green until vehicles approach on \nthe other road, plus A more cycles.\n\nUnfortunately, the signal F may also be 1 in the unused states of S,\nin which case the lights on both roads may remain red even though cars\nare waiting on one of the roads.  To avoid this behavior, we must be \nsure to initialize the state S to one of the six states in the\ndesired loop.\n\n\n\n",

This process is meant to\nhelp you understand how we can design an FSM that executes simple\npieces of a flow chart such as assignments, { if} statements, and \nloops.  Later, we generalize this concept and build an FSM that allows\nthe pieces to be executed to be specified after the FSM is built---in \nother words, the FSM executes a program specified by bits stored in \nmemory.  This more general model, as you might have already guessed, \nis a computer.  \n\n",

The fourth step is to calculate logic expressions and finally implementing with flip-flops and gates.

Each state will have its own set of actions that will execute when the FSM transitions into that state. Time-based transitions between states can be implemented using counters. The overall organization of the FSM should follow the stages of instruction processing in a processor control unit state machine diagram (fetch, decode, get operands, execution and write back results).",

Outputs for each state can be specified abstractly, which implies that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM. To implement an FSM as a digital system, all states must be represented as patterns using a fixed number of bits and all inputs and outputs must be translated into bits. Additionally, transition rules must be complete so that given any state of the FSM and any pattern of input bits, there is a defined transition from that state to another state."

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Laying Out Components}\n\n\nOur high-level FSM design tells us what our components need to be able to\ndo in any given cycle.  For example, when we load new values into the shift\nregisters that provide bits to the serial comparator, we always copy \n{ min} into one shift register and { values[idx]} into the second.\nUsing this information, we can put together our components and simplify our\ndesign by fixing the way in which bits flow between them.\n\nThe figure at the right shows how we can organize our components.\nAgain, in practice, one goes back and forth thinking about states,\ncomponents, and flow from state to state.  In these notes, we \npresent only a completed design.\n\nLet's take a detailed look at each of the components.\n\nAt the upper left of the figure is a {4-bit} binary counter called\n{ IDX} to hold the { idx}\nvariable.  The counter can be reset to 0 using the { RST} input.\nOtherwise, the { CNT} input controls whether or not the counter\nincrements its value.  With this counter design, we can force { idx} \nto 0 in the { WAIT} state and then count upwards in the { INIT}\nand { COPY} states.\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-components.eps,width=3.84in}}\n\n\nA memory labeled { VALUES} to hold the array { values} appears \nin the upper right of\nthe figure.  The read/write control for the memory is hardwired to 1 (read)\nin the figure, and the data input lines are unattached.  To integrate \nwith other logic that can operate our FSM, we need to add more \ncontrol logic to allow writing into the memory and to attach the data\ninputs to something that provides the data bits.  The address input of\nthe memory comes always from the { IDX} counter value; in other words,\nwhenever we access this memory by making use of the data output lines,\nwe read { values[idx]}.\n\nIn the middle left of the figure is a {32-bit} register for the \n{ min} variable.  It has a control input { LD} that \ndetermines whether or not it loads a new value at the end of the clock\ncycle.  If a new value is loaded, the new value always corresponds to\nthe output of the { VALUES} memory, { values[idx]}.  Recall\nthat { min} always changes in the { INIT} state, and may change\nin the { COPY} state.  But the new value stored in { min}\nis always { values[idx]}. \nNote also that when the FSM completes its task, the result of the \ncomputation is left in the { MIN} register for external logic to\nread (connections for this purpose are not shown in the figure).\n\nContinuing downward in the figure, we see two right shift registers\nlabeled { A} and { B}.  Each has a control input { LD}\nthat enables a parallel load.  Register { A} loads from register\n{ MIN}, and register { B} loads from the memory data output\n({ values[idx]}).  These loads are needed in the { PREP}\nstate of our FSM.  When { LD} is low, the shift registers\nsimply shifts to the right.  The serial output { SO} makes the\nleast significant bit of each shift register available.  Shifting\nis necessary to feed the serial comparator in the { COMPARE} state.\n\nBelow register { A} is a {5-bit} binary counter called { CNT}.\nThe counter is used to control the serial comparator in the { COMPARE}\nstate.  A reset input { RST} allows it to be forced to 0 in the \n{ PREP} state.  When the counter value is exactly zero, the \noutput { Z} is high.\n\n\n\nThe last major component is the serial comparator, which is based on the\ndesign developed in Notes Set 3.1.  The two bits to be compared in \na cycle come from shift registers { A} and { B}.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Laying Out Components}\n\n\nOur high-level FSM design tells us what our components need to be able to\ndo in any given cycle.  For example, when we load new values into the shift\nregisters that provide bits to the serial comparator, we always copy \n{ min} into one shift register and { values[idx]} into the second.\nUsing this information, we can put together our components and simplify our\ndesign by fixing the way in which bits flow between them.\n\nThe figure at the right shows how we can organize our components.\nAgain, in practice, one goes back and forth thinking about states,\ncomponents, and flow from state to state.  In these notes, we \npresent only a completed design.\n\nLet's take a detailed look at each of the components.\n\nAt the upper left of the figure is a {4-bit} binary counter called\n{ IDX} to hold the { idx}\nvariable.  The counter can be reset to 0 using the { RST} input.\nOtherwise, the { CNT} input controls whether or not the counter\nincrements its value.  With this counter design, we can force { idx} \nto 0 in the { WAIT} state and then count upwards in the { INIT}\nand { COPY} states.\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-components.eps,width=3.84in}}\n\n\nA memory labeled { VALUES} to hold the array { values} appears \nin the upper right of\nthe figure.  The read/write control for the memory is hardwired to 1 (read)\nin the figure, and the data input lines are unattached.  To integrate \nwith other logic that can operate our FSM, we need to add more \ncontrol logic to allow writing into the memory and to attach the data\ninputs to something that provides the data bits.  The address input of\nthe memory comes always from the { IDX} counter value; in other words,\nwhenever we access this memory by making use of the data output lines,\nwe read { values[idx]}.\n\nIn the middle left of the figure is a {32-bit} register for the \n{ min} variable.  It has a control input { LD} that \ndetermines whether or not it loads a new value at the end of the clock\ncycle.  If a new value is loaded, the new value always corresponds to\nthe output of the { VALUES} memory, { values[idx]}.  Recall\nthat { min} always changes in the { INIT} state, and may change\nin the { COPY} state.  But the new value stored in { min}\nis always { values[idx]}. \nNote also that when the FSM completes its task, the result of the \ncomputation is left in the { MIN} register for external logic to\nread (connections for this purpose are not shown in the figure).\n\nContinuing downward in the figure, we see two right shift registers\nlabeled { A} and { B}.  Each has a control input { LD}\nthat enables a parallel load.  Register { A} loads from register\n{ MIN}, and register { B} loads from the memory data output\n({ values[idx]}).  These loads are needed in the { PREP}\nstate of our FSM.  When { LD} is low, the shift registers\nsimply shifts to the right.  The serial output { SO} makes the\nleast significant bit of each shift register available.  Shifting\nis necessary to feed the serial comparator in the { COMPARE} state.\n\nBelow register { A} is a {5-bit} binary counter called { CNT}.\nThe counter is used to control the serial comparator in the { COMPARE}\nstate.  A reset input { RST} allows it to be forced to 0 in the \n{ PREP} state.  When the counter value is exactly zero, the \noutput { Z} is high.\n\n\n\nThe last major component is the serial comparator, which is based on the\ndesign developed in Notes Set 3.1.  The two bits to be compared in \na cycle come from shift registers { A} and { B}.  The first\nbit indicator comes from the zero indicator of counter { CNT}.\nThe comparator actually produces two outputs ({ Z1} and { Z0}),\nbut the meaning of the\n{ Z1} output by itself is { A > B}.  In the diagram,\nthis signal has been labeled { THEN}.\n\nThere are two additional elements in the figure that we have yet to discuss.\nEach simply compares the value in a register with a fixed constant and \nproduces a {1-bit} signal.  When the FSM finishes an iteration of\nthe loop in the { COPY} state, it must check the loop condition\n({ 10 > idx}) and move either to the { PREP} state or, when\nthe loop finishes, to the { WAIT} state to let the external logic\nread the answer from the { MIN} register.  The loop is done when the\ncurrent iteration count is nine, so we compare { IDX} with nine to\nproduce the { DONE} signal.  The other constant comparison is between\nthe counter { CNT} and the value 31 to produce the { LAST} signal,\nwhich indicates that the serial comparator is on its last cycle of \ncomparison.  In the cycle after { LAST} is high, the { THEN} \noutput of the comparator indicates whether or not { A > B}.\n\n",

We developed ripple carry adders in this way in \nNotes Set 2.3 and both unsigned and 2's complement comparators in \nNotes Set 2.4.\n\n\nAnother interesting design strategy is { serialization}: rather than \nreplicating the bit slice, we can use flip-flops to store the bits passed\nfrom one bit slice to the next, then present the stored bits { to the\nsame bit slice} in the next cycle.  Thus, in a serial design, we only\nneed one copy of the bit slice logic!  The area needed for a serial design\nis usually much less than for a bit-sliced design, but such a design is\nalso usually slower.  After illustrating the general design strategy,\nwe'll consider these tradeoffs more carefully\nin the context of a detailed example.\n\n\nRecall the general bit-sliced design approach, as illustrated to the right.\n\nSome number of copies of the logic for a single bit slice are connected\nin sequence.  Each bit slice accepts P bits of operand input and\nproduces Q bits of external output.  Adjacent bit slices receive\nan additional M bits of information from the previous bit slice\nand pass along M bits to the next bit slice, generally using some\nrepresentation chosen by the designer.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/gen-slice-comp.eps,width=3.8in}\n\n\nThe first bit slice is initialized\nby passing in constant values, and some calculation may be performed\non the final bit slice's results to produce R bits more external output.\n\n\n\nWe can transform this bit-sliced design to a serial design with a single\ncopy of the bit slice logic, M+Q flip-flops, and M gates (and sometimes\nan inverter).  The strategy is illustrated on the right below.  A single\ncopy of the bit slice operates on one set of P external input bits \nand produces one set of Q external output bits each clock cycle.  In\nthe design shown, these output bits are available during the next \ncycle, after they have been stored in the flip-flops. \nThe M bits to be passed to the ``next'' bit slice are also \nstored in flip-flops,\nand in the next cycle are provided back to the same physical bit slice\nas inputs.  The first cycle of a multi-cycle operation\nmust be handled slightly differently, so we\nadd selection logic and an control signal, F.  For the first cycle, we\napply F=1, and the initial values are passed into the bit slice.  \nFor all other bits, we apply F=0, and the values stored in the flip-flops\nare returned to the bit slice's inputs.  After all bits have passed through\nthe bit slice---after N cycles for an {N-bit} design---the\nfinal M bits are stored in the flip-flops, and the results are calculated\nby the output logic. \n\n{\n\n{file=part3/figs/init-ser-slice.eps,width=1.4in}\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ser-slice-comp.eps,width=3.25in}\n\n}\n\nThe selection logic merits explanation.  Given that the original design\ninitialized the bits to constant values (0s or 1s), we need only simple\nlogic for selection.  The two drawings on the left above illustrate \nhow {B_i}, the complemented flip-flop output for a bit i, can be\ncombined with the first-cycle signal F to produce an appropriate input\nfor the bit slice.  Selection thus requires one extra gate for each of \nthe M inputs, and we need an inverter for F if any of the initial \nvalues is 1.\n\n\n",

We developed ripple carry adders in this way in \nNotes Set 2.3 and both unsigned and 2's complement comparators in \nNotes Set 2.4.\n\n\nAnother interesting design strategy is { serialization}: rather than \nreplicating the bit slice, we can use flip-flops to store the bits passed\nfrom one bit slice to the next, then present the stored bits { to the\nsame bit slice} in the next cycle.  Thus, in a serial design, we only\nneed one copy of the bit slice logic!  The area needed for a serial design\nis usually much less than for a bit-sliced design, but such a design is\nalso usually slower.  After illustrating the general design strategy,\nwe'll consider these tradeoffs more carefully\nin the context of a detailed example.\n\n\nRecall the general bit-sliced design approach, as illustrated to the right.\n\nSome number of copies of the logic for a single bit slice are connected\nin sequence.  Each bit slice accepts P bits of operand input and\nproduces Q bits of external output.  Adjacent bit slices receive\nan additional M bits of information from the previous bit slice\nand pass along M bits to the next bit slice, generally using some\nrepresentation chosen by the designer.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/gen-slice-comp.eps,width=3.8in}\n\n\nThe first bit slice is initialized\nby passing in constant values, and some calculation may be performed\non the final bit slice's results to produce R bits more external output.\n\n\n\nWe can transform this bit-sliced design to a serial design with a single\ncopy of the bit slice logic, M+Q flip-flops, and M gates (and sometimes\nan inverter).  The strategy is illustrated on the right below.  A single\ncopy of the bit slice operates on one set of P external input bits \nand produces one set of Q external output bits each clock cycle.  In\nthe design shown, these output bits are available during the next \ncycle, after they have been stored in the flip-flops. \nThe M bits to be passed to the ``next'' bit slice are also \nstored in flip-flops,\nand in the next cycle are provided back to the same physical bit slice\nas inputs.  The first cycle of a multi-cycle operation\nmust be handled slightly differently, so we\nadd selection logic and an control signal, F.  For the first cycle, we\napply F=1, and the initial values are passed into the bit slice.  \nFor all other bits, we apply F=0, and the values stored in the flip-flops\nare returned to the bit slice's inputs.  After all bits have passed through\nthe bit slice---after N cycles for an {N-bit} design---the\nfinal M bits are stored in the flip-flops, and the results are calculated\nby the output logic. \n\n{\n\n{file=part3/figs/init-ser-slice.eps,width=1.4in}\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ser-slice-comp.eps,width=3.25in}\n\n}\n\nThe selection logic merits explanation.  Given that the original design\ninitialized the bits to constant values (0s or 1s), we need only simple\nlogic for selection.  The two drawings on the left above illustrate \nhow {B_i}, the complemented flip-flop output for a bit i, can be\ncombined with the first-cycle signal F to produce an appropriate input\nfor the bit slice.  Selection thus requires one extra gate for each of \nthe M inputs, and we need an inverter for F if any of the initial \nvalues is 1.\n\n\n",

The result is shown to the right.\nIn terms of the general model, the single comparator bit slice accepts P=2\nbits of inputs each cycle, in this case a single bit from each of the two\nnumbers being compared, presented to the bit slice in increasing order\nof significance.  The bit slice produces no external output other than\nthe final result (Q=0).

In all other cycles, F=0, and the NOR gates\nset C_1=B_1 and C_0=B_0.  Finally, after N cycles for an {N-bit}\ncomparison, the output logic---in this case simply wires, as shown \nin the dashed box---places the result of the comparison on \nthe Z_1 and Z_0 outputs (R=2 in the general model).  \nThe result is encoded in the \nrepresentation defined for constructing the bit slice (see Notes Set 2.4,\nbut the encoding does not matter here).\n\n\nHow does the serial design compare with the bit-sliced design?\n\nAs an estimate of area, let's count gates.  Our optimized \ndesign is replicated to the right for convenience.  \n\nEach bit slice requires six {2-input} gates and two inverters.  \n\nAssume that each \nflip-flop requires eight {2-input} gates and two inverters,\nso the serial design overall requires 24 gates\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/comparator-opt-nn.eps,width=4.1in}\n\n\nand six inverters to handle any number of bits.\n\nThus, for any number of bits N, the serial design is smaller\nthan the bit-sliced design, and the benefit grows with N.\n\nWhat about performance?  In Notes Set 2.4, we counted gate delays for \nour bit-sliced design.  The path from A or B to the outputs is\nfour gate delays, but the C to Z paths are all two gate delays.\nOverall, then, the bit-sliced design requires 2N+2 gate delays \nfor N bits.  What about the serial design?\n\nThe performance of the serial design is likely to be much worse\nfor three reasons.\n\nFirst, all paths in the design matter, not just the paths from bit\nslice to bit slice.  None of the inputs can be assumed to be available\nbefore the start of the clock cycle, so we must consider all paths\nfrom input to output.  \n\nSecond, we must also count gate delays for the\nselection logic as well as the gates embedded in the flip-flops.\n\nFinally, the result of these calculations may not matter, since the\nclock speed may well be limited by other logic elsewhere in the\nsystem.  If we want a common clock for all of our logic, the clock\nmust not go faster than the slowest element in the entire system, or\nsome of our logic will not work properly.\n\nWhat is the longest path through our serial comparator?\n\nLet's assume that \nthe path through a flip-flop is eight gate delays, with four on each \nside of the clock's rising edge.  The inputs A and B are\nlikely to be driven by flip-flops elsewhere in our system, so\nwe conservatively count four gate delays to A and B and\nfive gate delays to C_1 and C_0 (the extra one comes from\nthe selection logic).  The A and B paths thus dominate inside\nthe bit slice, adding four more gate delays to the outputs Z_1\nand Z_0.  Finally, we add the last four gate delays to flip\nthe first latch in the flip-flops for a total of 12 gate delays.\n\nIf we assume that our serial comparator limits the clock frequency\n(that is, if everything else in the system can use a faster clock),\nwe take 12 gate delays per cycle, or 12N gate delays to compare\ntwo {N-bit} numbers.\n\nYou might also notice that adding support for 2's complement is no \nlonger free.  We need extra logic to swap the A and B inputs\nin the cycle corresponding to the sign bits of A and B.  In\nother cycles, they must remain in the usual order.  This extra\nlogic is not complex, but adds further delay to the paths.\n\nThe bit-sliced and serial designs represent two extreme points in \na broad space of design possibilities.  Optimization of the entire\nN-bit logic function (for any metric) represents a third extreme.\nAs an engineer, you should realize that you can design systems\nanywhere in between these points as well.  At the end of Notes Set 2.4,\nfor example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares \ntwo bits at a time.

In any given state,\na particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this \ncombination is called a { transition rule}.\n\nAn FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of \npossible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules,\nand methods for calculating outputs.  \n\nWhen an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be\nrepresented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must\nbe translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.\n\nFor a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words,\ngiven any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits,\na transition must be defined from that state to another state \n(transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops}, \nare acceptable).\n\nAnd, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces\nto Boolean logic expressions.\n\nIn this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations,\nin which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.\n\nIn this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and\nanalyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next\nfew weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control\nlogic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections\nbetween FSMs and software and will make some connections with other\nareas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital \ncontrol systems.\n\nThe table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical \nkeyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the\nstates rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each\nstate---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states.\nThe description of the states in the first column is an optional element\noften included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying\nthe states needed for the design.\nA list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in\nthe list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.\n\nBy including outputs for each state,\nwe implicitly assume that outputs depend only on\nthe state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail\nlater in these notes (see ``Machine Models''), \nbut will make the assumption throughout our class.\n\n\n\n{\n\nmeaning& state& driver's door& other doors& alarm on \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& locked& locked& no\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& unlocked& locked& no\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& unlocked& unlocked& no\nalarm sounding& ALARM& locked& locked& yes\n\n}\n\n\n\nAnother tool used with FSMs is the { next-state table} (sometimes\ncalled a { state transition table}, or just a { state table}), \nwhich maps the current state and input combination into the next state of \nthe FSM.  The abstract variant shown below outlines desired behavior at\na high level, and is often ambiguous, incomplete, and even inconsistent.\nFor example, what happens if a user pushes two buttons?  What happens\nif they push unlock while the alarm is sounding?  These questions \nshould eventually be considered.  However, we can already start to see \nthe intended use of the design: starting from a locked car, a user\ncan push ``unlock'' once to gain entry to the driver's seat, or push\n``unlock'' twice to open the car fully for passengers.  To lock the\ncar, a user can push the ``lock'' button at any time.  And, if a user\nneeds help, pressing the ``panic'' button sets off an alarm. \n\n\n\n{\n\nstate& action/input& next state \nLOCKED& push ``unlock''& DRIVER\nDRIVER& push ``unlock''& UNLOCKED\n(any)& push ``lock''& LOCKED\n(any)& push ``panic''& ALARM\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nA { state transition diagram} (or { transition diagram}, or\n{ state diagram}),\nas shown to the right, illustrates the\ncontents of the next-state table graphically, with each state drawn\nin a circle, and arcs between states labeled with the input combinations\nthat cause these transitions from one state to another.\n\nPutting the FSM design into this graphical form does not solve the\nproblems with the abstract model.  The questions that we asked\nin regard to the next-state table remain unanswered.\n\nImplementing an FSM using digital logic requires that we translate\nthe design into bits, eliminate any ambiguity, and complete the\nspecification.  How many internal bits should we use?  What are the\npossible input values, and how are their meanings represented in bits? \nWhat are the possible output values, and how are their meanings\nrepresented in bits?  We will consider these questions for several\nexamples in the coming weeks.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-abs-trans-diag.eps,width=3.45in}\n\n\nFor now, we simply define answers for our example design, the keyless\nentry system.  Given four states, we need at \nleast _2(4)=2 bits of internal state, which we\nstore in two flip-flops and call S_1S_0.  The table below lists input\nand output signals and defines their meaning. \n\n{\n\noutputs&D& driver door; 1 means unlocked\n&R& other doors (remaining doors); 1 means unlocked\n&A& alarm; 1 means alarm is sounding\ninputs& U& unlock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& L& lock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& P& panic button; 1 means it has been pressed\n\n}\n\nWe can now choose a representation for our states and rewrite the list\nof states, using bits both for the states and for the outputs.  We\nalso include the meaning of each state for clarity in our example.\nNote that we can choose the internal representation in any way.  Here\nwe have matched the D and R outputs when possible to simplify\nthe output logic needed for the implementation.  The order of states\nin the list is not particularly important, but should be chosen for\nconvenience and clarity (including transcribing bits into to {K-maps}, \nfor example).\n\n{\n\n& & & driver's door& other doors& alarm on\nmeaning& state& S_1S_0& D& R& A \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& 00& 0& 0& 0\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& 10& 1& 0& 0\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& 11& 1& 1& 0\nalarm sounding& ALARM& 01& 0& 0& 1\n\n}\n\n\n\nWe can also rewrite the next-state table in terms of bits.  We use\nGray code order on both axes, as these orders make it more \nconvenient to use {K-maps}.  The values represented in this table \nare the next FSM state given the current state S_1S_0 and the\ninputs U, L, and P.  Our symbols for the next-state bits\nare S_1^+ and S_0^+.  The ``+'' superscript\nis a common way of expressing\nthe next value in a discrete series, here induced by the use of\nclocked synchronous logic in implementing the FSM.  In other words,\nS_1^+ is the value of S_1 in the next clock cycle, and S_1^+\nin an FSM implemented as a digital system is a Boolean expression\nbased on the current state and the inputs.  For our example problem, we\nwant to be able to write down expressions for S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P) \nand S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P), as well as expressions for the \noutput logic D(S_1,S_0), R(S_1,S_0), and A(S_1,S_0). \n\n\n{\n{c|cccccccc}\ncurrent state & {|c}{ULP}\nS_1S_0& 000& 001& 011& 010& 110& 111& 101& 100 \n00& 00& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 10\n01& 01& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 01\n11& 11& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11\n10& 10& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11 \n\n}\n\n\nIn the process of writing out the next-state table, \nwe have made decisions for all of the questions that we asked earlier\nregarding the abstract state table.  These decisions are also reflected\nin the complete state transition diagram shown to the right.\nThe states have been extended with state bits and output bits,\nas S_1S_0/DRA.\nYou should recognize that we can\nalso leave some questions unanswered by placing x's (don't cares)\ninto our table.  However, you should also understand at this point\nthat any implementation will produce bits, not x's, so we must be\ncareful not to allow arbitrary choices unless any of the choices\nallowed is indeed acceptable for our FSM's purpose.  We will discuss\nthis process and the considerations necessary as we cover more FSM\ndesign examples.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-trans-diag.eps,width=4.2in}\n\n\nWe have deliberately omitted calculation of expressions for the\nnext-state variables S_1^+ and S_0^+,\nand for the outputs D,\nR, and A.

In any given state,\na particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this \ncombination is called a { transition rule}.\n\nAn FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of \npossible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules,\nand methods for calculating outputs.  \n\nWhen an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be\nrepresented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must\nbe translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.\n\nFor a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words,\ngiven any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits,\na transition must be defined from that state to another state \n(transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops}, \nare acceptable).\n\nAnd, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces\nto Boolean logic expressions.\n\nIn this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations,\nin which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.\n\nIn this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and\nanalyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next\nfew weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control\nlogic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections\nbetween FSMs and software and will make some connections with other\nareas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital \ncontrol systems.\n\nThe table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical \nkeyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the\nstates rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each\nstate---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states.\nThe description of the states in the first column is an optional element\noften included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying\nthe states needed for the design.\nA list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in\nthe list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.\n\nBy including outputs for each state,\nwe implicitly assume that outputs depend only on\nthe state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail\nlater in these notes (see ``Machine Models''), \nbut will make the assumption throughout our class.\n\n\n\n{\n\nmeaning& state& driver's door& other doors& alarm on \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& locked& locked& no\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& unlocked& locked& no\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& unlocked& unlocked& no\nalarm sounding& ALARM& locked& locked& yes\n\n}\n\n\n\nAnother tool used with FSMs is the { next-state table} (sometimes\ncalled a { state transition table}, or just a { state table}), \nwhich maps the current state and input combination into the next state of \nthe FSM.  The abstract variant shown below outlines desired behavior at\na high level, and is often ambiguous, incomplete, and even inconsistent.\nFor example, what happens if a user pushes two buttons?  What happens\nif they push unlock while the alarm is sounding?  These questions \nshould eventually be considered.  However, we can already start to see \nthe intended use of the design: starting from a locked car, a user\ncan push ``unlock'' once to gain entry to the driver's seat, or push\n``unlock'' twice to open the car fully for passengers.  To lock the\ncar, a user can push the ``lock'' button at any time.  And, if a user\nneeds help, pressing the ``panic'' button sets off an alarm. \n\n\n\n{\n\nstate& action/input& next state \nLOCKED& push ``unlock''& DRIVER\nDRIVER& push ``unlock''& UNLOCKED\n(any)& push ``lock''& LOCKED\n(any)& push ``panic''& ALARM\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nA { state transition diagram} (or { transition diagram}, or\n{ state diagram}),\nas shown to the right, illustrates the\ncontents of the next-state table graphically, with each state drawn\nin a circle, and arcs between states labeled with the input combinations\nthat cause these transitions from one state to another.\n\nPutting the FSM design into this graphical form does not solve the\nproblems with the abstract model.  The questions that we asked\nin regard to the next-state table remain unanswered.\n\nImplementing an FSM using digital logic requires that we translate\nthe design into bits, eliminate any ambiguity, and complete the\nspecification.  How many internal bits should we use?  What are the\npossible input values, and how are their meanings represented in bits? \nWhat are the possible output values, and how are their meanings\nrepresented in bits?  We will consider these questions for several\nexamples in the coming weeks.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-abs-trans-diag.eps,width=3.45in}\n\n\nFor now, we simply define answers for our example design, the keyless\nentry system.  Given four states, we need at \nleast _2(4)=2 bits of internal state, which we\nstore in two flip-flops and call S_1S_0.  The table below lists input\nand output signals and defines their meaning. \n\n{\n\noutputs&D& driver door; 1 means unlocked\n&R& other doors (remaining doors); 1 means unlocked\n&A& alarm; 1 means alarm is sounding\ninputs& U& unlock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& L& lock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& P& panic button; 1 means it has been pressed\n\n}\n\nWe can now choose a representation for our states and rewrite the list\nof states, using bits both for the states and for the outputs.  We\nalso include the meaning of each state for clarity in our example.\nNote that we can choose the internal representation in any way.  Here\nwe have matched the D and R outputs when possible to simplify\nthe output logic needed for the implementation.  The order of states\nin the list is not particularly important, but should be chosen for\nconvenience and clarity (including transcribing bits into to {K-maps}, \nfor example).\n\n{\n\n& & & driver's door& other doors& alarm on\nmeaning& state& S_1S_0& D& R& A \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& 00& 0& 0& 0\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& 10& 1& 0& 0\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& 11& 1& 1& 0\nalarm sounding& ALARM& 01& 0& 0& 1\n\n}\n\n\n\nWe can also rewrite the next-state table in terms of bits.  We use\nGray code order on both axes, as these orders make it more \nconvenient to use {K-maps}.  The values represented in this table \nare the next FSM state given the current state S_1S_0 and the\ninputs U, L, and P.  Our symbols for the next-state bits\nare S_1^+ and S_0^+.  The ``+'' superscript\nis a common way of expressing\nthe next value in a discrete series, here induced by the use of\nclocked synchronous logic in implementing the FSM.  In other words,\nS_1^+ is the value of S_1 in the next clock cycle, and S_1^+\nin an FSM implemented as a digital system is a Boolean expression\nbased on the current state and the inputs.  For our example problem, we\nwant to be able to write down expressions for S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P) \nand S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P), as well as expressions for the \noutput logic D(S_1,S_0), R(S_1,S_0), and A(S_1,S_0). \n\n\n{\n{c|cccccccc}\ncurrent state & {|c}{ULP}\nS_1S_0& 000& 001& 011& 010& 110& 111& 101& 100 \n00& 00& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 10\n01& 01& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 01\n11& 11& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11\n10& 10& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11 \n\n}\n\n\nIn the process of writing out the next-state table, \nwe have made decisions for all of the questions that we asked earlier\nregarding the abstract state table.  These decisions are also reflected\nin the complete state transition diagram shown to the right.\nThe states have been extended with state bits and output bits,\nas S_1S_0/DRA.\nYou should recognize that we can\nalso leave some questions unanswered by placing x's (don't cares)\ninto our table.  However, you should also understand at this point\nthat any implementation will produce bits, not x's, so we must be\ncareful not to allow arbitrary choices unless any of the choices\nallowed is indeed acceptable for our FSM's purpose.  We will discuss\nthis process and the considerations necessary as we cover more FSM\ndesign examples.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-trans-diag.eps,width=4.2in}\n\n\nWe have deliberately omitted calculation of expressions for the\nnext-state variables S_1^+ and S_0^+,\nand for the outputs D,\nR, and A.  We expect that you are able to do so from the \ndetailed state table above, and may assign such an exercise as\npart of your homework.\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Addressing Architectures*}\n\nOne question remains for the definition of instruction formats: how\nmany addresses are needed for each instruction, and how many of the\naddresses can be memory addresses?  The first part of this question\nusually ranges from zero to three, and is rarely allowed to go\nbeyond three.  The answer to the second part determines the {\naddressing architecture} implemented by an ISA.  We now illustrate the\ntradeoffs between five distinct addressing architectures through the\nuse of a running example, the assignment X=AB+C/D.\n\nA binary operator requires two source operands and one destination\noperand, for a total of three addresses.  The ADD instruction, for\nexample, has a { {3-address}} format:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B,C>; M[A]  M[B] + M[C]\n>or>ADD>R1,R2,R3>; R1  R2 + R3\n{-6pt}\n\nIf all three addresses can be memory addresses, the ISA is dubbed a\n{ memory-to-memory architecture}.  Such architectures may have\nsmall register sets or even lack a register file completely.  To\nimplement the assignment, we assume the availability of two memory\nlocations, T1 and T2, for temporary storage:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>MUL>T1,A,B>; T1  M[A] * M[B]\n>DIV>T2,C,D>; T2  M[C] / M[D]\n>ADD>X,T1,T2>; X  M[T1] + M[T2]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment requires only three instructions to implement, but each\ninstruction contains three full memory addresses, and is thus quite long.\n\nAt the other extreme is the { load-store architecture} used by the\n{LC-3} ISA.  In a load-store architecture, only\nloads and stores can use memory addresses; all other operations use\nonly registers.  As most instructions use only registers, this type of\naddressing architecture is also called a { register-to-register\narchitecture}.  The example assignment translates to the code shown below,\nwhich assumes that R1, R2, and R3 are free for use (the instructions\nare { NOT} {LC-3} instructions, but rather a generic assembly\nlanguage for a load-store architecture). \n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>LD>R2,B>; R2  M[B]\n>MUL>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 * R2\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>LD>R3,D>; R3  M[D]\n>DIV>R2,R2,R3>; R2  R2 / R3\n>ADD>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nEight instructions are necessary, but no instruction requires more\nthan one full memory address, and several use only register addresses,\nallowing the use of shorter instructions.  The need to move data in\nand out of memory explicitly, however, also requires a reasonably\nlarge register set, as is available in the ARM, Sparc, Alpha, and IA-64\nISAs.  \n\nArchitectures that use other combinations of memory and register\naddresses with {3-address} formats are not named.  Unary\noperators and transfer operators require only one source operand, thus\ncan use a {2-address} format (for example, NOT A,B).  Binary operations\ncan also use { {2-address}} format if one operand is implicit,\nas in the following instructions:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B>; M[A]  M[A] + M[B]\n>or>ADD>R1,B>; R1  R1 + M[B]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe second instruction, in which one address is a register and the\nsecond is a memory address, defines a { register-memory\narchitecture}.  As shown by the code on the next page, \nsuch architectures strike a balance\nbetween the two architectures just discussed.\n\n\n\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>MUL>R1,B>; R1  R1 * M[B]\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>DIV>R2,D>; R2  R2 / M[D]\n>ADD>R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment now requires six instructions using at most one memory\naddress each; like memory-to-memory architectures, register-memory\narchitectures use relatively few registers.  Note that two-register\noperations are also allowed.  Intel's x86 ISA is a register-memory\narchitecture.\n\nSeveral ISAs of the past{The 6510/6502 as well, if memory\nserves, as the 8080, Z80, and Z8000, which used to drive parlor video\ngames.}  used a special-purpose register called the accumulator for\nALU operations, and are called { accumulator architectures}.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Addressing Architectures*}\n\nOne question remains for the definition of instruction formats: how\nmany addresses are needed for each instruction, and how many of the\naddresses can be memory addresses?  The first part of this question\nusually ranges from zero to three, and is rarely allowed to go\nbeyond three.  The answer to the second part determines the {\naddressing architecture} implemented by an ISA.  We now illustrate the\ntradeoffs between five distinct addressing architectures through the\nuse of a running example, the assignment X=AB+C/D.\n\nA binary operator requires two source operands and one destination\noperand, for a total of three addresses.  The ADD instruction, for\nexample, has a { {3-address}} format:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B,C>; M[A]  M[B] + M[C]\n>or>ADD>R1,R2,R3>; R1  R2 + R3\n{-6pt}\n\nIf all three addresses can be memory addresses, the ISA is dubbed a\n{ memory-to-memory architecture}.  Such architectures may have\nsmall register sets or even lack a register file completely.  To\nimplement the assignment, we assume the availability of two memory\nlocations, T1 and T2, for temporary storage:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>MUL>T1,A,B>; T1  M[A] * M[B]\n>DIV>T2,C,D>; T2  M[C] / M[D]\n>ADD>X,T1,T2>; X  M[T1] + M[T2]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment requires only three instructions to implement, but each\ninstruction contains three full memory addresses, and is thus quite long.\n\nAt the other extreme is the { load-store architecture} used by the\n{LC-3} ISA.  In a load-store architecture, only\nloads and stores can use memory addresses; all other operations use\nonly registers.  As most instructions use only registers, this type of\naddressing architecture is also called a { register-to-register\narchitecture}.  The example assignment translates to the code shown below,\nwhich assumes that R1, R2, and R3 are free for use (the instructions\nare { NOT} {LC-3} instructions, but rather a generic assembly\nlanguage for a load-store architecture). \n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>LD>R2,B>; R2  M[B]\n>MUL>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 * R2\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>LD>R3,D>; R3  M[D]\n>DIV>R2,R2,R3>; R2  R2 / R3\n>ADD>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nEight instructions are necessary, but no instruction requires more\nthan one full memory address, and several use only register addresses,\nallowing the use of shorter instructions.  The need to move data in\nand out of memory explicitly, however, also requires a reasonably\nlarge register set, as is available in the ARM, Sparc, Alpha, and IA-64\nISAs.  \n\nArchitectures that use other combinations of memory and register\naddresses with {3-address} formats are not named.  Unary\noperators and transfer operators require only one source operand, thus\ncan use a {2-address} format (for example, NOT A,B).  Binary operations\ncan also use { {2-address}} format if one operand is implicit,\nas in the following instructions:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B>; M[A]  M[A] + M[B]\n>or>ADD>R1,B>; R1  R1 + M[B]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe second instruction, in which one address is a register and the\nsecond is a memory address, defines a { register-memory\narchitecture}.  As shown by the code on the next page, \nsuch architectures strike a balance\nbetween the two architectures just discussed.\n\n\n\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>MUL>R1,B>; R1  R1 * M[B]\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>DIV>R2,D>; R2  R2 / M[D]\n>ADD>R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment now requires six instructions using at most one memory\naddress each; like memory-to-memory architectures, register-memory\narchitectures use relatively few registers.  Note that two-register\noperations are also allowed.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Procedure and System Calls*}\n\nA { procedure} is a sequence of instructions that executes a\nparticular task.  Procedures are used as building blocks for multiple,\nlarger tasks.  The concept of a procedure is fundamental to\nprogramming, and appears in some form in every high-level language as\nwell as in most ISAs.\n\nFor our purposes, the terms procedure, subroutine,\nfunction, and method are synonymous, although they usually have\nslightly different meanings from the linguistic point of view.\nProcedure calls are supported through { call} and { return}\ncontrol flow instructions.  The first instruction in the code below,\nfor example, transfers control to the procedure ``DoSomeWork,'' which\npresumably does some work, then returns control to the instruction\nfollowing the call.\n\n{-6pt}\n\n=DoSomeWork:WW=WWWW=DoSomeWorkWW= \n>loop:>CALL>DoSomeWork\n>>CMP>R6,#1>; compare return value in R6 to 1\n>>BEQ>loop>; keep doing work until R6 is not 1\n\n>DoSomeWork:>>> ; set R6 to 0 when all work is done, 1 otherwise \n>>RETN\n\n{-6pt}\n\nThe procedure also places a return value in R6, which the instruction\nfollowing the call compares with immediate value 1.  Until the two are\nnot equal (when all work is done), the branch returns control to the\ncall and executes the procedure again.\n\nAs you may recall, the call and return use the stack pointer to keep\ntrack of nested calls.  Sample RTL for these operations appears below.\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{call RTL}&&SP  SP - 1\n&& M[SP]  PC\n&& PC  {procedure start}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{return RTL}&&PC  M[SP]\n&&SP  SP + 1\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\nWhile an ISA provides the call and return instructions necessary to\nsupport procedures, it does not specify how information is passed to\nor returned from a procedure.  A standard for such decisions is\nusually developed and included in descriptions of the architecture,\nhowever.  This { calling convention} specifies how information is\npassed between a caller and a callee.  In particular, it specifies the\nfollowing: where arguments must be placed, either in registers or in\nspecific stack memory locations; which registers can be used or\nchanged by the procedure; and where any return value must be placed.\n\nThe term ``calling convention'' is also used in the programming\nlanguage community to describe the convention for deciding what\ninformation is passed for a given call operation.  For example, are\nvariables passed by value, by pointers to values, or in some other\nway?  However, once the things to be sent are decided, the\narchitectural calling convention that we discuss here is used\nto determine where to put the data in order for the callee to be able\nto find it.\n\nCalling conventions for architectures with large register sets\ntypically pass arguments in registers, and nearly all conventions\nplace the return value in a register.  A calling convention also\ndivides the register set into { caller-saved} and \n{ callee-saved} registers.  Caller-saved registers can be modified \narbitrarily\nby the called procedure, whereas any value in a callee-saved register\nmust be preserved.  Similarly, before calling a procedure, a caller\nmust preserve the values of any caller saved registers that are needed\nafter the call.  Registers of both types usually saved on the stack by\nthe appropriate code (caller or callee).\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical stack structure appears in the figure to the right.  In\npreparation for a call, a caller first stores any caller-saved\nregisters on the stack.  Arguments to the procedure to be called are\npushed next.  The procedure is called next, implicitly pushing the\nreturn address (the address of the instruction following the call\ninstruction).  Finally, the called procedure may allocate space on the\nstack for storage of callee-saved registers as well as local\nvariables.\n\nAs an example, the following calling convention can be applied to \nan {8-register} load-store architecture similar to the {LC-3}\nISA: the first three arguments must be placed in R0 through R2 (in order), \nwith any remaining arguments on the stack; the return value must be placed \nin R6; R0 through R2 are caller-saved, as\nis R6, while R3 through R5 are callee-saved; R7 is used as the stack\npointer.  The code fragments below use this calling convention to\nimplement a procedure and a call of that procedure.\n\n\n{file=part4/figs/lec23-2.eps,width=1.25in}\n\n\n[t]\n{\n[t]\n\nint =add3 (int n1, int n2, int n3) {\n>return (n1 + n2 + n3);\n}\n\nprintf (``d'', add3 (10, 20, 30));\n\n\n\nby convention:\n= n1 is in R0\n>n2 is in R1\n>n3 is in R2\n>return value is in R6\n\n\n\n[t]\n\nadd3:  = WWWW= WWWWW= \nadd3:>ADD>R0,R0,R1\n>ADD>R6,R0,R2\n>RETN\n>\n>PUSH>R1>; save the value in R1\n>LDI>R0,#10>; marshal arguments\n>LDI>R1,#20\n>LDI>R2,#30\n>CALL>add3\n>MOV>R1,R6>; return value becomes 2nd argument\n>LDI>R0,``d''>; load a pointer to the string\n>CALL>printf\n>POP>R1>; restore R1\n\n\n\nThe add3 procedure takes three integers as arguments, adds them\ntogether, and returns the sum.  The procedure is called with the\nconstants 10, 20, and 30, and the result is printed.  By the calling\nconvention, when the call is made, R0 must contain the value 10, R1\nthe value 20, and R2 the value 30.  We assume that the caller wants to\npreserve the value of R1, but does not care about R3 or R5.  In the\nassembly language version on the right, R1 is first saved to the\nstack, then the arguments are marshaled into position, and finally the\ncall is made.  The procedure itself needs no local storage and does\nnot change any callee-saved registers, thus must simply add the\nnumbers together and place the result in R6.  After add3 returns, its\nreturn value is moved from R6 to R1 in preparation for the call to\nprintf.  After loading a pointer to the format string into R0, the\nsecond call is made, and R1 is restored, completing the translation.\n\n{ System calls} are almost identical to procedure calls.  As with\nprocedure calls, a calling convention is used: before invoking a\nsystem call, arguments are marshaled into the appropriate registers or\nlocations in the stack; after a system call returns, any result\nappears in a pre-specified register.  The calling convention used for\nsystem calls need not be the same as that used for procedure calls.\nRather than a call instruction, system calls are usually initiated\nwith a { trap} instruction, and system calls are also known as\ntraps.  With many architectures, a system call places the processor in\nprivileged or kernel mode, and the instructions that implement the\ncall are considered to be part of the operating system.  The term\nsystem call arises from this fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Procedure and System Calls*}\n\nA { procedure} is a sequence of instructions that executes a\nparticular task.  Procedures are used as building blocks for multiple,\nlarger tasks.  The concept of a procedure is fundamental to\nprogramming, and appears in some form in every high-level language as\nwell as in most ISAs.\n\nFor our purposes, the terms procedure, subroutine,\nfunction, and method are synonymous, although they usually have\nslightly different meanings from the linguistic point of view.\nProcedure calls are supported through { call} and { return}\ncontrol flow instructions.  The first instruction in the code below,\nfor example, transfers control to the procedure ``DoSomeWork,'' which\npresumably does some work, then returns control to the instruction\nfollowing the call.\n\n{-6pt}\n\n=DoSomeWork:WW=WWWW=DoSomeWorkWW= \n>loop:>CALL>DoSomeWork\n>>CMP>R6,#1>; compare return value in R6 to 1\n>>BEQ>loop>; keep doing work until R6 is not 1\n\n>DoSomeWork:>>> ; set R6 to 0 when all work is done, 1 otherwise \n>>RETN\n\n{-6pt}\n\nThe procedure also places a return value in R6, which the instruction\nfollowing the call compares with immediate value 1.  Until the two are\nnot equal (when all work is done), the branch returns control to the\ncall and executes the procedure again.\n\nAs you may recall, the call and return use the stack pointer to keep\ntrack of nested calls.  Sample RTL for these operations appears below.\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{call RTL}&&SP  SP - 1\n&& M[SP]  PC\n&& PC  {procedure start}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{return RTL}&&PC  M[SP]\n&&SP  SP + 1\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\nWhile an ISA provides the call and return instructions necessary to\nsupport procedures, it does not specify how information is passed to\nor returned from a procedure.  A standard for such decisions is\nusually developed and included in descriptions of the architecture,\nhowever.  This { calling convention} specifies how information is\npassed between a caller and a callee.  In particular, it specifies the\nfollowing: where arguments must be placed, either in registers or in\nspecific stack memory locations; which registers can be used or\nchanged by the procedure; and where any return value must be placed.\n\nThe term ``calling convention'' is also used in the programming\nlanguage community to describe the convention for deciding what\ninformation is passed for a given call operation.  For example, are\nvariables passed by value, by pointers to values, or in some other\nway?  However, once the things to be sent are decided, the\narchitectural calling convention that we discuss here is used\nto determine where to put the data in order for the callee to be able\nto find it.\n\nCalling conventions for architectures with large register sets\ntypically pass arguments in registers, and nearly all conventions\nplace the return value in a register.  A calling convention also\ndivides the register set into { caller-saved} and \n{ callee-saved} registers.  Caller-saved registers can be modified \narbitrarily\nby the called procedure, whereas any value in a callee-saved register\nmust be preserved.  Similarly, before calling a procedure, a caller\nmust preserve the values of any caller saved registers that are needed\nafter the call.  Registers of both types usually saved on the stack by\nthe appropriate code (caller or callee).\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical stack structure appears in the figure to the right.  In\npreparation for a call, a caller first stores any caller-saved\nregisters on the stack.  Arguments to the procedure to be called are\npushed next.  The procedure is called next, implicitly pushing the\nreturn address (the address of the instruction following the call\ninstruction).

The RTL writes\nto two types of registers: the register file and the condition codes.\nTo accomplish these simultaneous writes, LD.REG and LD.CC must be high.\nNo other registers in the datapath should change, so the other five\nLD signals---LD.MAR, LD.MDR, LD.IR, LD.BEN, and LD.PC---should be low.\n\nWhat about the bus?  In order to write the result of the add operation\ninto the register file, the control signals must allow the ALU to write\nits result on to the bus.  So we need GateALU=1.  And the other Gate\nsignals---GatePC, GateMDR, and GateMARMUX---must all be 0.  The \ncondition codes are also calculated from the value on the bus, but\nthey are calculated on the same value as is written to the register\nfile (by the definition of the {LC-3} ISA).\n\nIf the RTL for an FSM state implicitly requires more than one value \nto appear on the bus in the same cycle, that state is impossible to \nimplement using the given datapath.  Either the datapath or the state \nmachine must be changed in such a case.  The textbook's design has been \nfairly thoroughly tested and debugged.\n\n\nThe earlier figure of the datapath does not \nshow all of the muxes.  The remaining muxes appear in the figure \nto the right (Patt and Patel Figure C.6).\n\nSome of the muxes in the datapath must be used to enable the\naddition needed for ADD to occur.  The\nDRMUX must select its IR[11:9] \ninput in order to write to the destination register specified by the \nADD instruction.  Similarly, the SR1MUX must select its IR[8:6] input \nin order to\n\n\n{file=part4/patt-patel-appendix-C/APPC06.eps,width=4.45in}\n\n\npass the first source register specified by the ADD to the ALU as input A\n(see the datapath figure).  SR2MUX is always controlled by the \nmode bit IR[5], so the control unit does not need to generate anything\n(note that this signal was not in the list given earlier).\n\nThe rest of the muxes in the datapath---PCMUX, ADDR1MUX, ADDR2MUX, and\nMARMUX---do not matter, and the signals controlling them are don't cares.\nFor example, since the PC does not change, the output of the PCMUX\nis simply discarded, thus which input the PCMUX forwards to its output\ncannot matter.\n\nThe ALU must perform an addition, so we must set the operation type\nALUK appropriately.  And memory should not be enabled (MIO.EN=0),\nin which case the read/write control for memory, R.W, is a don't\ncare.

And the other Gate\nsignals---GatePC, GateMDR, and GateMARMUX---must all be 0.  The \ncondition codes are also calculated from the value on the bus, but\nthey are calculated on the same value as is written to the register\nfile (by the definition of the {LC-3} ISA).\n\nIf the RTL for an FSM state implicitly requires more than one value \nto appear on the bus in the same cycle, that state is impossible to \nimplement using the given datapath.  Either the datapath or the state \nmachine must be changed in such a case.  The textbook's design has been \nfairly thoroughly tested and debugged.\n\n\nThe earlier figure of the datapath does not \nshow all of the muxes.  The remaining muxes appear in the figure \nto the right (Patt and Patel Figure C.6).\n\nSome of the muxes in the datapath must be used to enable the\naddition needed for ADD to occur.  The\nDRMUX must select its IR[11:9] \ninput in order to write to the destination register specified by the \nADD instruction.  Similarly, the SR1MUX must select its IR[8:6] input \nin order to\n\n\n{file=part4/patt-patel-appendix-C/APPC06.eps,width=4.45in}\n\n\npass the first source register specified by the ADD to the ALU as input A\n(see the datapath figure).  SR2MUX is always controlled by the \nmode bit IR[5], so the control unit does not need to generate anything\n(note that this signal was not in the list given earlier).\n\nThe rest of the muxes in the datapath---PCMUX, ADDR1MUX, ADDR2MUX, and\nMARMUX---do not matter, and the signals controlling them are don't cares.\nFor example, since the PC does not change, the output of the PCMUX\nis simply discarded, thus which input the PCMUX forwards to its output\ncannot matter.\n\nThe ALU must perform an addition, so we must set the operation type\nALUK appropriately.  And memory should not be enabled (MIO.EN=0),\nin which case the read/write control for memory, R.W, is a don't\ncare.  These 25 signal values together (including seven don't cares)\nimplement the RTL for the single state of execution for an \nADD instruction.\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Using a Memory for Logic Functions}\n\nConsider a case in which you need to compute many functions on a small \nnumber of bits, such as we just described for the multi-cycle, hardwired\ncontrol unit.  One strategy is to use a memory (possibly a read-only memory).\nA {2^m} memory can be viewed as computing N arbitrary\nfunctions on m variables.  The functions to be computed are specified\nby filling in the bits of the memory.  So long as the value of m is fairly\nsmall, the memory (especially SRAM) can be fast.\n\nSynthesis tools (or hard work) can, of course, produce smaller designs\nthat use fewer gates.  Actually, tools may be able to optimize a fixed\ndesign expressed as read-only memory, too.  But designing the functions\nwith a memory makes them easier to modify later.  If we make a mistake,\nfor example, in computing one of the functions, we need only change a bit\nor two in the memory instead of solving equations and reoptimizing and\nreplacing logic gates.  We can also extend our design if we have space\nremaining (that is, if the functions are undefined for some combinations \nof the m inputs).  The\nCray T3D supercomputer, for example, used a similar approach to add\nnew instructions to the Alpha processors on which it was based.\n\nThis strategy is effective in many contexts, so let's briefly discuss two \nanalogous cases.  In software, a memory becomes a lookup table.  Before\nhandheld calculators, lookup tables were used by humans to compute \ntranscendental functions such as sines, cosines, logarithms.  Computer \ngraphics hardware and software used a similar approach for transcendental\nfunctions in order to reduce cost and improve \nspeed.  Functions such as counting 1 bits in a word are useful for \nprocessor scheduling and networking, but not all ISAs provide this type\nof instruction.  In such cases, lookup tables in software are often the\nbest solution.\n\nIn programmable hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs),\nlookup tables (called LUTs in this context) have played an important role\nin implementing arbitrary logic functions.\n\nThe FPGA is the modern form of the programmable logic array (PLA)\nmentioned in the textbook, and will be your main tool \nfor developing digital hardware in ECE385.\n\nFor many years, FPGAs served as a hardware prototyping platform, but\nmany companies today ship their first round products using \ndesigns mapped to FPGAs.  Why?  Chips are more and more expensive\nto design, and mistakes are costly to fix.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Using a Memory for Logic Functions}\n\nConsider a case in which you need to compute many functions on a small \nnumber of bits, such as we just described for the multi-cycle, hardwired\ncontrol unit.  One strategy is to use a memory (possibly a read-only memory).\nA {2^m} memory can be viewed as computing N arbitrary\nfunctions on m variables.  The functions to be computed are specified\nby filling in the bits of the memory.  So long as the value of m is fairly\nsmall, the memory (especially SRAM) can be fast.\n\nSynthesis tools (or hard work) can, of course, produce smaller designs\nthat use fewer gates.  Actually, tools may be able to optimize a fixed\ndesign expressed as read-only memory, too.  But designing the functions\nwith a memory makes them easier to modify later.  If we make a mistake,\nfor example, in computing one of the functions, we need only change a bit\nor two in the memory instead of solving equations and reoptimizing and\nreplacing logic gates.  We can also extend our design if we have space\nremaining (that is, if the functions are undefined for some combinations \nof the m inputs).  The\nCray T3D supercomputer, for example, used a similar approach to add\nnew instructions to the Alpha processors on which it was based.\n\nThis strategy is effective in many contexts, so let's briefly discuss two \nanalogous cases.  In software, a memory becomes a lookup table.  Before\nhandheld calculators, lookup tables were used by humans to compute \ntranscendental functions such as sines, cosines, logarithms.  Computer \ngraphics hardware and software used a similar approach for transcendental\nfunctions in order to reduce cost and improve \nspeed.  Functions such as counting 1 bits in a word are useful for \nprocessor scheduling and networking, but not all ISAs provide this type\nof instruction.  In such cases, lookup tables in software are often the\nbest solution.\n\nIn programmable hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs),\nlookup tables (called LUTs in this context) have played an important role\nin implementing arbitrary logic functions.\n\nThe FPGA is the modern form of the programmable logic array (PLA)\nmentioned in the textbook, and will be your main tool \nfor developing digital hardware in ECE385.\n\nFor many years, FPGAs served as a hardware prototyping platform, but\nmany companies today ship their first round products using \ndesigns mapped to FPGAs.  Why?  Chips are more and more expensive\nto design, and mistakes are costly to fix.  In contrast, while\ncompanies pay more to buy an FPGA than to produce a chip (after the \nfirst chip!), errors in the design can usually be fixed by sending \ncustomers a new version through the Internet.\n\nLet's return to our {LC-3} example.\n\nInstead of solving the {K-maps}, we can use a small memory:\n2^ bits (27,648 bits total).\n\nWe just need calculate the bits, put\nthem into the memory, and use the memory to produce the control signals.\n\nThe ``address'' input to the memory are the same 10 bits that we\nneeded for our combinational logic: IR[15:11], R, BEN, and the FSM counter.\nThe data outputs of the memory are the control signals and the\nRESET and PAUSE inputs to the FSM counter.

However, the converse need not be true.  A representation can\nhave several bit patterns representing the same value, and\nnot all bit patterns in a representation need be\nused to represent values.\n\nLet's consider a few example of representations with unused patterns.\nHistorically, one common class of representations of this type was \nthose used to represent individual decimal digits.  We examine three\nexamples from this class.\n\nThe first is Binary-coded Decimal (BCD), in which\ndecimal digits are encoded individually \nusing their representations in the unsigned\n(binary) representation.  Since we have 10 decimal digits, we need \n10 patterns, and four bits for each digit.  But four bits allow \n2^4=16 bit patterns.  In BCD, the patterns 1010,1011,,1111\nare unused.  It is important to note that BCD is not the same as the\nunsigned representation.  The decimal number 732, for example, requires 12 bits\nwhen encoded as BCD: 0111 0011 0010.  When written using a {12-bit}\nunsigned representation, 732 is written 001011011100.  Operations\non BCD values were implemented in early processors, including the\n8086, and are thus still available in the x86 instruction set architecture\ntoday!\n\n\nThe second example is an {Excess-3} code, in which each decimal\ndigit d is represented by the pattern corresponding to the \n{4-bit} unsigned pattern for d+3.  For example, the digit 4\nis represented as 0111, and the digit 7 is represented as 1010.\nThe {Excess-3} code has some attractive aspects when using \nsimple hardware.  For example, we can use a {4-bit} binary \nadder to add two digits c and d represented in the {Excess-3} code, \nand the carry out signal produced by the adder is the same as the carry\nout for the decimal addition, since c+d is equivalent to \n(c+3)+(d+3).\n\nThe third example of decimal digit representations is a {2-out-of-5}\ncode.  In such a code, five bits are used to encode each digit.  \n\nOnly patterns with exactly two 1s are used.  There are exactly ten \nsuch patterns, and an example representation is shown to the right (more\nthan one assignment of values to patterns has been used in real systems).\n\n\n{c|c}\n& a 2-out-of-5\ndigit& representation \n1& 00011\n2& 00101\n3& 00110\n4& 01001\n5& 01010\n6& 01100\n7& 10001\n8& 10010\n9& 10100\n0& 11000\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A representation can\nhave several bit patterns representing the same value, and\nnot all bit patterns in a representation need be\nused to represent values.\n\nLet's consider a few example of representations with unused patterns.\nHistorically, one common class of representations of this type was \nthose used to represent individual decimal digits.  We examine three\nexamples from this class.\n\nThe first is Binary-coded Decimal (BCD), in which\ndecimal digits are encoded individually \nusing their representations in the unsigned\n(binary) representation.  Since we have 10 decimal digits, we need \n10 patterns, and four bits for each digit.  But four bits allow \n2^4=16 bit patterns.  In BCD, the patterns 1010,1011,,1111\nare unused.  It is important to note that BCD is not the same as the\nunsigned representation.  The decimal number 732, for example, requires 12 bits\nwhen encoded as BCD: 0111 0011 0010.  When written using a {12-bit}\nunsigned representation, 732 is written 001011011100.  Operations\non BCD values were implemented in early processors, including the\n8086, and are thus still available in the x86 instruction set architecture\ntoday!\n\n\nThe second example is an {Excess-3} code, in which each decimal\ndigit d is represented by the pattern corresponding to the \n{4-bit} unsigned pattern for d+3.  For example, the digit 4\nis represented as 0111, and the digit 7 is represented as 1010.\nThe {Excess-3} code has some attractive aspects when using \nsimple hardware.  For example, we can use a {4-bit} binary \nadder to add two digits c and d represented in the {Excess-3} code, \nand the carry out signal produced by the adder is the same as the carry\nout for the decimal addition, since c+d is equivalent to \n(c+3)+(d+3).\n\nThe third example of decimal digit representations is a {2-out-of-5}\ncode.  In such a code, five bits are used to encode each digit.  \n\nOnly patterns with exactly two 1s are used.  There are exactly ten \nsuch patterns, and an example representation is shown to the right (more\nthan one assignment of values to patterns has been used in real systems).\n\n\n{c|c}\n& a 2-out-of-5\ndigit& representation \n1& 00011\n2& 00101\n3& 00110\n4& 01001\n5& 01010\n6& 01100\n7& 10001\n8& 10010\n9& 10100\n0& 11000\n\n\n\n\n\n",
