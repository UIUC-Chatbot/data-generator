            "question": " How does PC-Relative Mode help with data movement in the processor's data path?",
            "answers": [
                "PC-Relative Mode is an addressing mode in which bits [8:0] of the instruction specify an offset relative to the PC. It helps with data movement in the processor's data path by allowing the computation of the memory address to be loaded or stored, based on the current value of the PC, thereby facilitating the transfer of data between memory and the specified general-purpose register.",
                "PC-Relative Mode helps with data movement in the processor's data path by computing the memory address using the PC and an offset specified in the instruction, allowing data to be accessed efficiently from nearby memory locations.",
                "PC-Relative Mode helps with data movement in the processor's data path by using the Program Counter (PC) register to calculate the location of data or instructions within the program, making the data movement more efficient and streamlined."
