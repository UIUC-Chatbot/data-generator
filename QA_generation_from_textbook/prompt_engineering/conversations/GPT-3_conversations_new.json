Finally, we illustrate how the choice of representation\nfor the FSM's internal state affects the complexity of the implementation.\nFortunately, designs that are more intuitive and easier for humans to\nunderstand also typically make the best designs in terms of \nother metrics, such as logic complexity.\n\n\n",

            "conversations1": "\nStudent : I'm having a little trouble understanding the design process for FSMs. Can you walk me through it?\n\nTeacher: Sure. The design process for a digital FSM typically begins with the development of an abstract model. This abstract model captures the essential behavior of the FSM, without getting bogged down in concrete details. Once the abstract model is complete, it can be used to generate a concrete implementation.\n\nStudent : Can you give me an example of an abstract model?\n\nTeacher: One common example is a state transition diagram. This diagram captures the states and transitions of the FSM, without specifying how those states and transitions are implemented.\n\nStudent : OK, that makes sense. So once we have our state transition diagram, how do we generate an implementation?\n\nTeacher: There are a few different approaches, but one common method is to start by implementing the next-state logic functions. These functions take as input the current state and inputs to the FSM, and return the next state. Once these functions are implemented, they can be used to generate flip-flop equations which capture the internal state of the FSM. Finally, output logic functions can be generated which take as input the current state and outputs desired outputs from the FSM.",

            "conversations2": "\nStudent : What is a finite state machine?\nTeacher: A finite state machine is a mathematical model of computation used to design digital logic circuits. It is an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states. The FSM can read inputs and move to a new state, depending on the current state and the input. \nStudent : What are some examples of finite state machines?\nTeacher: Counters are a common type of finite state machine. They can be designed to count up or down, or to count in a sequence of numbers. Another example is a vending machine, which has a limited number of states: idle, waiting for money, waiting for selection, and dispensed product. \nStudent : How do you design a finite state machine?\nTeacher: The first step is to develop an abstract model of the system you want to design. This model should describe the behavior of the system without regard for how it will be implemented. Once you have your abstract model, you can begin designing the concrete implementation. This process involves translating the states and transitions into logic gates and flip-flops that will implement the behavior described by the abstract model. \nStudent : What are some challenges you might face when designing a finite state machine?\nTeacher: One challenge you might face is designing an FSM with multiple inputs that control its behavior. Another challenge is designing an FSM with more than two states. In both cases, you need to carefully consider how the different inputs or states will interact with each other in order to correctly design your FSM",

Let me see if I can explain it. First, you need to understand what your FSM is trying to do. What is the purpose of your machine?\nStudent : In this case, I'm trying to design a counter.\nTeacher : Okay, so your FSM is going to be counting something. That's the first thing you need to figure out: what are you counting? Once you know that, you can start designing your states. \nStudent: So my states would be the numbers 0-9? \nTeacher: Yes, that's right. Each number would be represented by a different state. \nStudent: And how do I determine the next state? \nTeacher: That depends on what you're trying to count. For example, if you're counting up from 0 to 9, then when the machine is in state 0 and it receives an input of 1, it will go to state 1. If it's in state 1 and it receives an input of 1 again, it will go to state 2, and so on until it reaches state 9. At that point, if it receives another input of 1 ,it will go back to state 0 and start counting again from 0 .",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Steps in the Design Process}\n\nBefore we begin exploring designs, let's talk briefly about the general\napproach that we take when designing an FSM.  We follow a six-step\nprocess:{-8pt}\n\n{{}{}\n{}{}{}\n{develop an abstract model}{step-abs}\n{specify I/O behavior}{step-io}\n{complete the specification}{step-complete}\n{choose a state representation}{step-repn}\n{calculate logic expressions}{step-logic}\n{implement with flip-flops and gates}{step-gates}\n}\n{-8pt}\n\nIn Step {step-abs}, we translate our description in human language\ninto a model with states and desired behavior.  At this stage, we \nsimply try to capture the intent of the description and are not\nparticularly thorough nor exact.\n\nStep {step-io} begins to formalize the model, starting with its\ninput and output behavior.  If we eventually plan to develop an\nimplementation of our FSM as a digital system (which is not the \nonly choice, of course!), all input and output\nmust consist of bits.  Often, input and/or output specifications\nmay need to match other digital systems to which we plan to connect\nour FSM.  In fact, { most problems in developing large digital systems\ntoday arise because of incompatibilities when composing two or more\nseparately designed pieces} (or { modules}) into an integrated system.\n\nOnce we know the I/O behavior for our FSM, in Step {step-complete}\nwe start to make\nany implicit assumptions clear and to make any other decisions\nnecessary to the design.  Occasionally, we may choose to leave\nsomething undecided in the hope of simplifying the design with\n``don't care'' entries in the logic formulation.\n\nIn Step {step-repn}, we select an internal representation\nfor the bits necessary to encode the state of our FSM.  In practice,\nfor small designs, this representation can be selected by a computer \nin such a way as to optimize the implementation.  However, for large\ndesigns, such as the LC-3 instruction set architecture that we\nstudy later in this class, humans do most of the work by hand.\n\nIn the later examples in this set of notes, we show how even a \nsmall design can\nleverage meaningful information from the design when selecting\nthe representation, leading to an implementation that is simpler\nand is easier to build correctly.\n\nWe also show how one can\nuse abstraction to simplify an implementation.\n\nBy Step {step-logic}, our design is a complete specification in\nterms of bits, and we need merely derive logic expressions for the\nnext-state variables and the output signals.  This process is no\ndifferent than for combinational logic, and should already be fairly \nfamiliar to you.\n\n\n\nFinally, in Step {step-gates}, we translate our logic expressions\ninto gates and use flip-flops (or registers) to hold the internal\nstate bits of the FSM.  In later notes, we use more complex\nbuilding blocks when implementing an FSM, building up abstractions\nin order to simplify the design process in much the same way that\nwe have shown for combinational logic.\n\n\n",

Sometimes.\nSometimes it works perfectly, but sometimes\nthe light glows cyan or red briefly first.\nAt other times, the light is an\nunchanging white.\n\n\nWhat could be going wrong?\n\nLet's try to understand.  We begin by deriving\nK-maps for the implementation, as shown to the right.  In these\nK-maps, each of the x's in our design has been replaced by either a 0\nor a 1.  These entries are highlighted with green italics.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/colS2-bad.eps,width=1.00in}\n\n{file=part3/figs/colS1-bad.eps,width=1.00in}\n\n{file=part3/figs/colS0-bad.eps,width=1.00in}\n\n\nNow let's imagine what might happen if somehow our FSM got into the\nS_2S_1S_0=111 state.  In such a state, the light would appear white,\nsince RGB=S_2S_1S_0=111.\n\nWhat happens in the next cycle?\n\nPlugging into the equations or looking into the K-maps gives (of\ncourse) the same answer: the next state is the\nS_2^+S_1^+S_0^+=111 state.\nIn other words, the light stays white indefinitely!\n\nAs an exercise, you should check what happens \nif the light is red or cyan.\n\nWe can extend the transition diagram that we developed for our design\nwith the extra states possible in the implementation, as shown below.\nAs with the five states in the design, the extra states are named with\nthe color of light that they produce.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/colors-full.eps,width=5.8in}}\n\nNotice that the FSM does not move out of the WHITE state (ever).  \n\nYou may at this point wonder whether more careful decisions \nin selecting our next-state expressions might address this issue.\nTo some extent, yes.  For example, if we replace the \nS_2S_1 term in the equation for S_2^+ with S_2{{S_0}}, \na decision allowed\nby the ``don't care'' boxes in the K-map for our design,\nthe resulting transition diagram does not suffer from the problem\nthat we've found.\n\nHowever, even if we do change our implementation slightly, we need\nto address another aspect of the problem:\n\nhow can the FSM ever get into the unexpected states?\n\n\nWhat is the initial state of the three flip-flops in our implementation?\n\n{ The initial state may not even be 0s and 1s unless we have an \nexplicit mechanism for initialization.} \n\nInitialization can work in two ways.  \n\nThe first approach makes use of the flip-flop design.\nAs you know, a flip-flop is built from a pair of latches, and\nwe can \nmake use of the internal reset lines on these latches\nto force each flip-flop into the 0 state (or the 1 state) using an\nadditional input. \n\nAlternatively, we can add some extra logic to our design.\n\nConsider adding a few AND gates and a  input\n(active low), as shown in the dashed box in the figure to the right.\nIn this case, when we assert  by setting it to 0,\nthe FSM moves to state 000 in the next cycle, putting it into\nthe BLACK state.  The approach taken here is for clarity; one can\noptimize the design, if desired.  For example, we could simply connect\n as an extra input into the three AND gates on the\nleft rather than adding new ones, with the same effect.\n\nWe may sometimes want a more powerful initialization mechanism---one\nthat allows us to force the FSM into any specific state in the next\ncycle.  In such a case, we can add multiplexers to each of our \nflip-flop inputs, allowing us to use the INIT input to choose between\nnormal operation (INIT=0) of the FSM and forcing the FSM into the\nnext state given by I_2I_1I_0 (when INIT=1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Having drawn out a partial\ntransition diagram can help with this process, since we can use the\ndiagram to systematically consider all possible input conditions from\nall possible states.  The state table form can make the missing\nparts of the specification even more obvious.\n\n\n\n\nFor our counter, the symmetry between counting states makes the problem \nsubstantially simpler.  Let's write out part of a list of states and\npart of a state table with one \ncounting state and one halt state, as shown to the right.\nFour values of the inputs HG \nare possible (recall that N bits allow 2^N possible patterns).\nWe list the columns in Gray code order, since we may want to\ntranscribe this table into K-maps later.\n\n\n{\n\n& \nfirst counting state& { COUNT A}& counting, output Z_1Z_0=00\n  first halted state&  { HALT A}& halted, output Z_1Z_0=00\n\n\n{c|cccc}\n&{HG}\n        state&            00&            01&          11&           10 \n{ COUNT A}& { COUNT B}&   unspecified& unspecified& { HALT A}\n { HALT A}&  { HALT A}& { COUNT B}& unspecified&  unspecified\n\n\n\nLet's start with the { COUNT A} state.  \n\nWe know that if neither button is pressed (HG=00), we want \nthe counter to move to the { COUNT B} state.  And, if we press the\n``halt'' button (HG=10), we want the counter to move to the { HALT A}\nstate.  What should happen if a user presses the ``go'' button (HG=01)?\nOr if the user presses both buttons (HG=11)?\n\nAnswering these questions is part of fully specifying our design.  We\ncan choose to leave some parts unspecified, but { any implementation of\nour system will imply answers}, and thus we must be careful.\n\nWe choose to ignore the ``go'' button while counting, and to have the\n``halt'' button override the ``go'' button.  Thus, if HG=01 when the\ncounter is in state { COUNT A}, the counter moves to state { COUNT B}.\nAnd, if HG=11, the counter moves to state { HALT A}.\n\nUse of explicit bit patterns for the inputs HG may help you to check \nthat all four possible input values are covered from each state.  If \nyou choose to use a transition diagram instead of a state table,\nyou might even want to add four arcs from each state, each labeled \nwith a specific\nvalue of HG.  When two arcs connect the same two states, we can either \nuse multiple labels or can indicate bits that do not matter using a\n{ don't-care} symbol, x.  For example, the arc from state { COUNT A}\nto state { COUNT B} could be labeled HG=00,01 or HG=0x.  The\narc from state { COUNT A} to state { HALT A} could be labeled\nHG=10,11 or HG=1x.  We can also use logical expressions as labels,\nbut such notation can obscure unspecified transitions.\n\nNow consider the state { HALT A}.  The transitions specified so far\nare that when we press ``go'' (HG=01), the counter moves to \nthe { COUNT B} state, and that the counter remains halted in \nstate { HALT A} if no buttons are pressed (HG=00).\nWhat if the ``halt'' button is pressed (HG=10), or\nboth buttons are pressed (HG=11)?  For consistency, we decide that\n``halt'' overrides ``go,'' but does nothing special if it alone is pressed\nwhile the counter is halted.  Thus, input patterns HG=10 and HG=11 also \ntake state { HALT A} back to itself.\nHere the arc could be labeled HG=00,10,11 or, equivalently,\nHG=00,1x or HG=x0,11.\n\n\nTo complete our design, we apply the same decisions that we made for \nthe { COUNT A} state to all of the other counting states, and the \ndecisions that we made for the { HALT A} state to all of the other \nhalted states.  If we had chosen not to specify an answer, an implementation\ncould produce different behavior from the different counting\nand/or halted states, which might confuse a user.\n\nThe resulting design appears to the right.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Choosing a State Representation}\n\nNow we need to select a representation for the states.  Since our counter\nhas eight states, we need at least three (_2 (8)=3)\nstate bits S_2S_1S_0 to keep track of the current state.\n\nAs we show later, { the choice of representation for an FSM's states\ncan dramatically affect the design complexity}.  For a design as simple as \nour counter, you could just let a computer implement all possible \nrepresentations (there aren't more than 840, if we consider simple \nsymmetries) and select one according to whatever metrics are interesting.\n\nFor bigger designs, however, the number of possibilities quickly becomes\nimpossible to explore completely.\n\nFortunately, { use of abstraction in selecting a representation \nalso tends to produce better designs} for a wide variety of metrics\n(such as design complexity, area, power consumption, and performance).\n\nThe right strategy is thus often to start by selecting a representation \nthat makes sense to a human, even if it requires more bits than are\nstrictly necessary.  The\nresulting implementation will be easier to\ndesign and to debug than an implementation in which only the global \nbehavior has any meaning.\n\n\nLet's return to our specific example, the counter.  We can use one bit, \nS_2, to record whether or not our counter is counting (S_2=0) or\nhalted (S_2=1).  The other two bits can then record the counter state\nin terms of the desired output.  Choosing this representation\nimplies that only wires will be necessary to compute outputs Z_1 \nand Z_0 from the internal state: Z_1=S_1 and Z_0=S_0.  The resulting\ndesign, in which states are now labeled with both internal state and\noutputs (S_2S_1S_0/Z_1Z_0) appears to the right.  In this version,\nwe have changed the arc labeling to use logical expressions, which\ncan sometimes help us to think about the implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent state listing and state table appear below.  We have ordered\nthe rows of the state table in Gray code order to simplify transcription\nof K-maps.\n\n\n\n& S_2S_1S_0& \n{ COUNT A}& 000& counting, output Z_1Z_0=00\n{ COUNT B}& 001& counting, output Z_1Z_0=01\n{ COUNT C}& 011& counting, output Z_1Z_0=11\n{ COUNT D}& 010& counting, output Z_1Z_0=10\n { HALT A}& 100& halted, output Z_1Z_0=00\n { HALT B}& 101& halted, output Z_1Z_0=01\n { HALT C}& 111& halted, output Z_1Z_0=11\n { HALT D}& 110& halted, output Z_1Z_0=10\n\n\n{rc|cccc}\n&&{HG}\n&S_2S_1S_0& 00& 01& 11& 10 \n{ COUNT A}&000& 001& 001& 100& 100\n{ COUNT B}&001& 011& 011& 101& 101\n{ COUNT C}&011& 010& 010& 111& 111\n{ COUNT D}&010& 000& 000& 110& 110\n { HALT D}&110& 110& 000& 110& 110\n { HALT C}&111& 111& 010& 111& 111\n { HALT B}&101& 101& 011& 101& 101\n { HALT A}&100& 100& 001& 100& 100\n\n\n\nHaving chosen a representation, we can go ahead and implement our\ndesign in the usual way.  As shown to the right, K-maps for the \nnext-state logic are complicated, since we have five variables\nand must consider implicants that are not contiguous in the K-maps.\nThe S_2^+ logic is easy enough: we only need two terms, \nas shown.\n\nNotice that we have used color and\nline style to distinguish different\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimplicants in the K-maps.  Furthermore, the symmetry of the design\nproduces symmetry in the S_1^+ and S_0^+ formula, so we have\nused the same color and line style for analogous terms in these\ntwo K-maps.\n\nFor S_1^+, we need four terms.  The green \nellipses in the HG=01 column are part of the same term, as are\nthe two halves of the dashed blue circle.  In S_0^+, we still\nneed four terms, but three of them are split into two pieces \nin the K-map.  As you can see, the utility of the K-map is starting\nto break down with five variables.\n\n\n",

Writing\nthe next-state logic algebraically, we obtain\n\n{eqnarray*}\nS_2^+ &=& HOLD\nS_1^+ &=&   S_0 + HOLD  S_1\nS_0^+ &=&   {{S_1}} + HOLD  S_0\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the similarity between the equations for S_1^+S_0^+ and the \nequations for a {2-to-1} mux: when HOLD=1, the counter retains \nits state, and when HOLD=0, it counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn implementation appears below.\n\nBy using semantic meaning in our choice of representation---in\nparticular the use of S_2 to record whether\nthe counter is currently halted (S_2=1) or counting (S_2=0)---we\nhave enabled ourselves to \nseparate out the logic for deciding whether to advance the counter\nfairly cleanly from the logic for advancing the counter itself.\nOnly the HOLD bit in the diagram is used to determine\nwhether or not the counter should advance in the current cycle.\n\nLet's check that the implementation matches our original design.\n\nStart by verifying that the HOLD variable is calculated correctly,\nHOLD=H+S_2,\nthen look back at the K-map for S_2^+ in the low-level design to\nverify that the expression we used does indeed match.\n\n\n\nNext, check the mux abstraction.\n\nWhen HOLD=1, the next-state logic for S_1^+ and S_0^+ \nreduces to S_1^+=S_1 and S_0^+=S_0;\nin other words, the counter stops counting and simply stays in its \ncurrent state.  When HOLD=0, these equations become\nS_1^+=S_0 and S_0^+={{S_1}}, which produces the repeating\nsequence for S_1S_0 of 00, 01, 11, 10, as desired.\nYou may want to look back at our two-bit Gray code counter design\nto compare the next-state equations.\n\nWe can now verify that the implementation produces the correct transition\nbehavior.  In the counting states, S_2=0, and the HOLD value simplifies\nto HOLD=H.  Until we push the ``halt'' button, S_2 remains 0, and\nand the counter continues to count in the correct sequence.\nWhen H=1, HOLD=1, and the counter stops at its current value\n(S_2^+S_1^+S_0^+=1S_1S_0, \nwhich is shorthand for S_2^+=1, S_1^+=S_1, and S_0^+=S_0).\n\nIn any of the halted states, S_2=1, and we can reduce HOLD to\nHOLD=H+.  Here, so long as we press the ``halt'' button\nor do not press the ``go'' button, the counter stays in its current\nstate, because HOLD=1.  If we release ``halt'' and press ``go,''\nwe have HOLD=0, and the counter resumes counting\n(S_2^+S_1^+S_0^+=0S_0{{S_1}},\nwhich is shorthand for S_2^+=0, S_1^+=S_0, and \nS_0^+={{S_1}}).\n\nWe have now verified the implementation.\n\nWhat if you wanted to build a three-bit Gray code counter with the same\ncontrols for starting and stopping?  You could go back to basics and struggle \nwith six-variable {K-maps}.  Or you could simply copy the HOLD \nmechanism from the two-bit design above, insert muxes between the next \nstate logic and the flip-flops of the three-bit Gray code counter that \nwe designed earlier, and control the muxes with the HOLD bit.  \nAbstraction is a powerful tool.\n\n\n\n",

In other words, what conditions need to be met in order for the counter not to advance? \nStudent: Right.

        "textbook-paragraph": "\n\nA computer { memory} is a group of storage elements and the logic\nnecessary to move data in and out of the elements.  The size of the\nelements in a memory---called the { addressability} of the \nmemory---varies from a single binary digit, or { bit},\nto a { byte} (8 bits) or more.  Typically, we refer to data\nelements larger than a byte as { words}, but the size of a word\ndepends on context. \n\nEach element in a memory is assigned a unique name, called an {\naddress}, that allows an external circuit to identify the particular\nelement of interest.  These addresses are not unlike the street\naddresses that you use when you send a letter.  Unlike street\naddresses, however, memory addresses usually have little or no\nredundancy; each possible combination of bits in an address identifies\na distinct set of bits in the memory.  The figure on the right below \nillustrates the concept.  Each house represents a storage element and \nis associated with a unique address.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/lec18-1.eps,width=4in}}\n\nThe memories that we consider in this class have several properties in\ncommon.  These memories support two operations: { write} places a\nword of data into an element, and { read} retrieves a copy of a\nword of data from an element.  The memories are also { volatile},\nwhich means that the data held by a memory are erased when electrical\npower is turned off or fails.  { Non-volatile} forms of memory\ninclude magnetic and optical storage media such as DVDs, CD-ROMs, disks, \nand tapes, capacitive storage media such as Flash drives,\nand some programmable logic devices.\nFinally, the memories considered in this class are { random access\nmemories (RAMs)}, which means that the time required to access an\nelement in the memory is independent of the element being accessed.\nIn contrast, { serial memories} such as magnetic tape require much\nless time to access data near the current location in the tape than\ndata far away from the current location.\n\nThe figure on the left above shows a generic RAM structure.  The\nmemory contains 2^k elements of N bits each.  A {k-bit}\naddress input, ADDR, identifies the memory element of interest for\nany particular operation.  The write enable\ninput, WE, selects the operation to be performed: if\nWE is high, the operation is a write; if it is low, the\noperation is a read.  Data to be written into an element are provided\nthrough N inputs at the top, and data read from an element appear on\nN outputs at the bottom.  Finally, a { chip select} input, CS,\nfunctions as an enable control for the memory; when CS is low, the\nmemory neither reads nor writes any location.\n\nRandom access memory further divides into two important types: {\nstatic RAM}, or { SRAM}, and { dynamic RAM}, or { DRAM}.\nSRAM employs active logic in the form of a two-inverter loop to\nmaintain stored values.  DRAM uses a charged capacitor to store a bit;\nthe charge drains over time and must be replaced, giving rise to the\nqualifier ``dynamic.''  ``Static'' thus serves only to differentiate\nmemories with active logic elements from those with capacitive\nelements.  Both types are volatile, that is, both lose all data when the\npower supply is removed.  We consider both SRAM and DRAM \nin this course, but the details of DRAM operation are beyond our scope. \n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Static Random Access Memory}\n\nStatic random access memory is used for high-speed applications such\nas processor caches and some embedded designs.  As SRAM bit\n{density---the} number of bits in a given chip {area---is}\nsignificantly lower than DRAM bit density, most applications with less\ndemanding speed requirements use DRAM.  The main memory in most\ncomputers, for example, is DRAM, whereas the memory on the same chip\nas a processor is SRAM.{Chips combining both DRAM and processor\nlogic are available, and are used by some processor manufacturers (such \nas IBM).  Research is underway to couple such logic types more efficiently\nby building 3D stacks of chips.}  DRAM is also unavailable\nwhen recharging its capacitors, which can be a problem for\napplications with stringent real-time needs.\n\n\nA diagram of an SRAM { cell} (a single bit) appears to\nthe right.  A dual-inverter loop stores the bit, and is connected\nto opposing BIT lines through transistors controlled by a SELECT\nline.  \n\nThe cell works as follows.  When SELECT is high, the\ntransistors connect the inverter loop to the bit lines.  When writing\na cell, the bit lines are held at opposite logic values, forcing the\ninverters to match the values on the lines and storing the value from\nthe BIT input.  When reading a cell, the bit lines are disconnected\nfrom other logic, allowing the inverters to drive the lines with\ntheir current outputs.  \n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec18-2.eps,width=2.20in}\n\n\nThe value stored previously is thus copied onto\nthe BIT line as an output, and the opposite value is placed on the\n line.  When SELECT is low, the transistors\ndisconnect the inverters from the bit lines, and the cell\nholds its current value until SELECT goes high again.\n\nThe actual operation of an SRAM cell is more complicated than we\nhave described.  For example, when writing a bit, the BIT lines \ncan temporarily connect high voltage to ground (a short).  The \ncircuit must be designed carefully to minimize the power consumed\nduring this process.  When reading a bit, the BIT lines\nare pre-charged halfway between high-voltage and ground, and \nanalog devices called sense amplifiers are used to detect the\nvoltage changes on the BIT lines (driven by the inverter loop)\nas quickly as possible.  These analog design issues are outside of \nthe scope of our class.\n\n\nA number of cells are combined into a { bit slice}, as shown to\nthe right.\n\nThe labels along the bottom of the figure are external inputs to the \nbit slice, and match the labels for the abstract\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec18-3.eps,width=5in}\n\n\nmemory discussed earlier.  The \nbit slice in the figure can be thought of as a {16-address},\n{1-bit-addressable} memory (2^4b).\n\nThe cells in a bit slice\nshare bit lines and analog read and write logic, which appears to the\nright in the figure.  Based on the ADDR input, a decoder sets one\ncell's SELECT line high to enable a read or write operation to the\ncell.  \n\nThe chip select input CS drives the enable input of\nthe decoder, so none of the memory cells is active when chip select is\nlow (CS=0), and exactly one of the memory cells is active when\nchip select is high (CS=1).\n\nActual bit slices can contain many more cells than are shown in the \nfigure---more cells means less extra logic per cell, but slower memory,\nsince longer wires have higher capacitance.\n\nA read operation is performed as follows.  We set CS=1 and WE=0,\nand place the address of the cell to be read on the ADDR input.\nThe decoder outputs a 1 on the appropriate cell's SELECT line,\nand the read logic reads the bit from the cell and delivers it\nto its Q output, which is then available on the bit \nslice's {DATA-OUT} output.\n\nFor a write operation, we set CS=1 and WE=1.  We again place the\naddress of the cell to be written on the ADDR input and set the\nvalue of the bit slice's {DATA-IN} input to the value to be written\ninto the memory cell.  When the decoder activates the cell's SELECT line,\nthe write logic writes the new value from its D input into\nthe memory cell.  Later reads from that cell then produce the new value.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/lec18-4.eps,width=6.15in}}\n\nThe outputs of the cell selection decoder can be used to control\nmultiple bit slices, as shown in the figure above of a {2^6b}\nmemory.  Selection between bit slices is\nthen based on other bits from the address (ADDR).  In the figure\nabove, a {2-to-4} decoder is used to deliver write requests to\none of four bit slices, and a {4-to-1} mux is used to choose\nthe appropriate output bit for read requests.\n\nThe {4-to-16} decoder now activates one cell in each of the four \nbit slices.  For a read operation, WE=0, and the {2-to-4} decoder \nis not enabled, so it outputs all 0s.  All four bit slices thus perform\nreads, and the desired result bit is forwarded to {DATA-OUT} by the \n{4-to-1} mux.  The tri-state buffer between the mux \nand {DATA-OUT} is explained in a later section.\n\nFor a write operation, exactly one of the bit\nslices has its WE input set to 1 by the {2-to-4} decoder.\nThat bit slice writes the bit value delivered to all bit slices\nfrom {DATA-IN}.  The other three bit slices perform reads, but their \nresults are simply discarded.\n\nThe approach shown above, in which a cell is selected\nthrough a two-dimensional indexing scheme, is known as { coincident\nselection}.  The qualifier ``coincident'' arises from the notion that\nthe desired cell coincides with the intersection of the active row and\ncolumn outputs from the decoders.\n\nThe benefit of coincident selection is easily calculated in terms of\nthe number of gates required for the decoders.  Decoder complexity is\nroughly equal to the number of outputs, as each output is a minterm\nand requires a unique gate to calculate it.  \n\n Fanout trees for input terms and inverted terms add relatively few gates.  \n\nConsider a 1M8b RAM chip.  The number of addresses is 2^,\nand the total number of memory cells is 8,388,608 (2^).\nOne option is to use eight bit slices and a {20-to-1,048,576}\ndecoder, or about 2^ gates.  Alternatively, we can use 8,192 bit\nslices of 1,024 cells.  For the second implementation, we need \ntwo {10-to-1024} decoders, or about 2^ gates.  As chip \narea is roughly proportional to the number of gates, the savings are \nsubstantial.  Other schemes are possible as well: if we want a more \nsquare chip area, we might choose to use 4,096 bit slices of 2,048 \ncells along with one {11-to-2048} decoder and\none {9-to-512} decoder.  This approach requires roughly 25 more\ndecoder gates than our previous example, but is still far superior to\nthe eight-bit-slice implementation.\n\nMemories are typically unclocked devices.  However, as you have seen,\nthe circuits are highly structured, which enables engineers to cope\nwith the complexity of sequential feedback design.  Devices used to\ncontrol memories are typically clocked, and the interaction between\nthe two can be fairly complex.  \n\n\nTiming diagrams for reads and writes\nto SRAM are shown to the right.  A write operation\nappears on the left.  In the first cycle, the controller raises the\nchip select signal and places the memory address to be written on the\naddress inputs.  Once the memory has had time to set up the \nappropriate\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec18-6.eps,width=4in}\n\n\nselect lines\ninternally, the WE input is raised, and data are placed\non the data inputs.  The delay, which is specified by the memory\nmanufacturer, is necessary to avoid writing data to the incorrect\nelement within the memory.  The timing shown in the\nfigure rounds this delay up to a single clock cycle, but the\nactual delay needed depends on the clock speed and the memory's \nspecification.  At some point after new data have been\ndelivered to the memory, the write operation completes within the\nmemory.  The time from the application of the address until the\n(worst-case) completion of the write operation is called the {\nwrite cycle} of the memory, and is also specified by the memory \nmanufacturer.  Once the write cycle has passed, the controlling logic \nlowers WE, waits for the change to settle within the memory,\nthen removes the address and lowers the chip select signal.  The\nreason for the delay between these signal changes is the same: to \navoid mistakenly overwriting another memory location.\n\nA read operation is quite similar.  As shown on the right, the\ncontrolling logic places the address on the input lines and raises the\nchip select signal.  No races need be considered, as read operations\non SRAM do not affect the stored data.  After a delay called the {\nread cycle}, the data can be read from the data outputs.  The address\ncan then be removed and the chip select signal lowered.\n\nFor both reads and writes, the number of cycles required for an\noperation depends on a combination of the clock cycle of the\ncontroller and the cycle time of the memory.  For example, with a\n25 nanosecond write cycle and a 10 nanosecond clock cycle, a write\nrequires three cycles.  In general, the number of cycles required is\ngiven by the formula {memory cycle time}/{clock cycle\ntime}.\n\n\n\n",

In the case shown, two {2^-bit} \nmemories are used to implement a {2^{k+1}-bit} memory.\nOne of the address bits---in the case shown, the most significant bit---is\nused to drive a decoder that determines which of the two chips is \nactive (CS=1).

While slower than SRAM, DRAM is denser (has\nmore bits per chip area).  A substantial part of DRAM density is\ndue to transistor count: typical SRAM cells use six transistors\n(two for each inverter, and two more to connect the inverters to the \nbit lines), while DRAM cells use only a single transistor.\nHowever, memory designers have also made significant advances in\nfurther miniaturizing DRAM cells to improve density beyond the \nbenefit available from simple transistor count.\n\n\nA diagram of a DRAM cell appears to the right.  \nDRAM storage is capacitive: a bit is stored by charging or not charging \na capacitor.  The capacitor is attached to a BIT line \nthrough a transistor controlled by a SELECT line.  \n\nWhen SELECT is low, the capacitor is isolated and \nholds its charge.  However, the transistor's resistance is\nfinite, and some charge leaks out onto the bit line.  Charge also\nleaks into the substrate on which the transistor is constructed.  After\nsome amount of time, all of the charge dissipates, and the bit is\nlost.  To avoid such loss, the cell must be { refreshed}\nperiodically by reading the contents and writing them back with active\nlogic.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec18-8.eps,width=1.1in}\n\n\nWhen the SELECT line is high during a write operation, logic driving\nthe bit line forces charge onto the capacitor or removes all charge\nfrom it.  For a read operation, the bit line is first brought to an\nintermediate voltage level (a voltage level between 0 and 1), then\nSELECT is raised, allowing the capacitor to either pull a small\namount of charge from the bit line or to push a small amount of charge\nonto the bit line.  The resulting change in voltage is then detected\nby a { sense amplifier} at the end of the bit line.  A sense amp \nis analogous to a marble on a mountaintop: a small push causes the\nmarble to roll rapidly downhill in the direction of the push.\nSimilarly, a small change in voltage causes a sense amp's output to\nmove rapidly to a logical 0 or 1, depending on the direction of the\nsmall change.  As mentioned earlier, sense amplifiers also appear in \nSRAM implementations.\nWhile not technically necessary, as they are with DRAM, the use of a\nsense amp to react to small changes in voltage makes reads faster.\n\nEach read operation on a DRAM cell brings the voltage on its capacitor\ncloser to the intermediate voltage level, in effect destroying the\ndata in the cell.  DRAM is thus said to have { destructive reads}.\nTo preserve data during a read, the bits must be written back\ninto the cells after a read.  For example, the output of the sense \namplifiers can\nbe used to drive the bit lines, rewriting the cells with the\nappropriate data.\n\nAt the chip level, typical DRAM inputs and outputs differ from those\nof SRAM.  \n\nDue to the large size and high density of DRAM,\naddresses are split into row and column components and provided\nthrough a common set of pins.  The DRAM stores the components in\nregisters to support this approach.  Additional inputs, known as the\n{ row} and { column address} {{ strobes}---RAS} and\nCAS, {respectively---are} used to indicate when address\ncomponents are available.  As\nyou might guess from the structure of coincident selection, DRAM\nrefresh occurs on a row-by-row basis (across bit slices---on columns\nrather than rows in the figures earlier in these notes, but the terminology\nof DRAM is a row).  Raising the SELECT line for a\nrow destructively reads the contents of all cells on that row, forcing\nthe cells to be rewritten and effecting a refresh.  The row is thus a\nnatural basis for the refresh cycle.  The DRAM data pins provide\nbidirectional signals for reading and writing elements of the DRAM.\nAn { output enable} input, OE, controls tri-state buffers with\nthe DRAM to determine whether or not the DRAM drives the data pins.\nThe WE input, which controls the type of operation, is\nalso present.\n\n\nTiming diagrams for writes and reads on a historical DRAM implementation\nappear to the right.  In both cases, the row component of the address is \nfirst applied to the address pins, then RAS is raised.  In the\nnext cycle of the controlling logic, the column component is applied\nto the address pins, and CAS is raised.  \n\nFor a write, as shown on the left, the WE signal and the\ndata can\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec18-9.eps,width=4in}\n\n\nalso be applied in the second cycle.  The DRAM has internal\ntiming and control logic that prevent races from overwriting an\nincorrect element (remember that the row and column addresses have to\nbe stored in registers).  The DRAM again specifies a write cycle,\nafter which the operation is guaranteed to be complete.  In order, the\nWE, CAS, and RAS signals are then lowered.  \n\nFor a read operation, the output enable signal, OE, is raised after\nCAS is raised.  The DATA pins, which should be floating (in other\nwords, not driven by any logic), are then driven by the DRAM.  After the \nread cycle, valid data appear on the DATA pins, and OE, CAS, and\nRAS are lowered in order after the data are read.\n\nModern DRAM chips are substantially more sophisticated than those\ndiscussed here, and many of the functions that used to be provided\nby external logic are now integrated onto the chips themselves.\n\nAs an example of modern DRAMs, one can obtain\nthe data sheet for Micron Semiconductor's 8Gb ({2^b},\nfor example) DDR4 SDRAM, which is 366 pages long as of 11 May 2016.\n\nThe ability to synchronize to an external clock has become prevalent in \nthe industry, leading to the somewhat confusing term SDRAM, which stands \nfor { synchronous DRAM}.  The memory structures themselves\nare still unclocked, but logic is provided on the chip to synchronize \naccesses to the external clock without the need for additional \nlogic.\n\nThe clock provided to the Micron chip just mentioned\ncan be as fast as 1.6 GHz, and data can be\ntransferred on both the rising and falling edges of the clock\n(hence the name DDR, or { double data rate}).  \n\nIn addition to row and\ncolumn components of the address, these chips further separate cells into\n{ banks} and groups of banks.  These allow a user to exploit parallelism\nby starting reads or writes to separate banks at the same time, thus\nimproving the speed at which data can move in and out of the memory.\n\nFor the {2^b} version of the Micron chip,\nthe cells are structured into 4 groups of 4 banks (16 banks total),\neach with 131,072 rows and 1,024 columns.  \n\nDRAM implementations provide interfaces for specifying\nrefresh operations in addition to reads and writes.\nManaging refresh timing and execution is\ngenerally left to an external DRAM controller.\n\nFor the Micron chip, refresh commands must be issued every \n7.8 microseconds at normal temperatures.  Each\ncommand refreshes about 2^ cells, so 8,192 commands refresh\nthe whole chip in less than 64 milliseconds.\n\nAlternatively, the chip can handle refresh on-chip in\norder to maintain memory contents when the rest of the system is \npowered down.\n\n\n\n",

But I'm not sure how they work.\nTeacher: Okay. A DRAM cell stores a bit by charging or not charging a capacitor. The capacitor is attached to a BIT line through a transistor controlled by a SELECT line. \nStudent: So the data is stored in the capacitor? \nTeacher: Yes. When the SELECT line is low, the capacitor is isolated and holds its charge. However, the transistor's resistance is finite, and some charge leaks out onto the bit line over time. \nStudent: So that's why DRAM cells have to be refreshed periodically? \nTeacher: Yes, exactly. If you don't refresh the cell periodically, the data will be lost over time. \nStudent: Okay, that makes sense. But how do you actually read or write data to a DRAM cell? \nTeacher: For a write operation, when the SELECT line is high during a write operation, logic driving the bit line forces charge onto the capacitor or removes all charge from it.

The coin\nthen rolls down a slope towards a gate controlled by a servo.  The gate\ncan be raised or lowered, and determines whether the coin exits from the\nother side or the bottom of the device.\n\nAs the coin rolls, it passes two optical sensors.{The full system\nactually allows four sensors to differentiate four types of coins, but\nour lab uses only two of these sensors.}  One of these sensors is \npositioned high enough above the slope that a dime passes beneath the\nsesnor, allowing the signal T produced by the sensor to tell us whether \nthe coin is a dime or a quarter.  The second sensor is positioned so\nthat all coins pass in front of it.  The sensor positions are chosen \ncarefully to ensure that, in the case of a quarter, the coin is still\nblocking the first sensor when it reaches the second sensor.  \nBlocked sensors give a signal of 1 in this design, so the rising edge \nthe signal from the second sensor can be used as a ``clock'' for our \nFSM.  When the rising edge occurs, the signal T from the first sensor \nindicates whether the coin is a quarter (T=1) or a dime (T=0).\n\n\nA sample timing diagram for the lab appears to the right.  The clock\nsignal generated by the lab is not only not a square wave---in other words,\nthe high and low portions are not equal---but is also unlikely to be periodic.\nInstead, the ``cycle'' is defined by the time between coin insertions.\nThe T signal serves as the single input to our FSM.  In the timing\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lab-timing.eps,width=2.55in}\n\n\ndiagram, T is shown as rising and falling before the clock edge.\nWe use positive edge-triggered flip-flops to implement our FSM,\nthus the aspect of the relative timing that matters to our design\nis that, when the clock rises, the value of T is stable and indicates \nthe type of coin entered.  The signal T may fall before or after\nthe clock does---the two are equivalent for our FSM's needs.\n\nThe signal A in the timing diagram is an output from the FSM, and\nindicates whether or not the coin should be accepted.

If the user enters a third dime (or a fourth, \nor a fifth, and so on), we want to reject the new dime as well.  \nIf the user enters a quarter, we want to accept the coin, at which point\nwe have received 35 cents (counting the first dime).  We use\nthis reasoning to complete the description of REJECTD.  We also create\nan analogous state, REJECTQ, to handle a user who inserts more than\none quarter.\n\nWhat should happen after a user has paid 35 cents and bought \none item?  The FSM at that point is in the PAID state, which delivers\nthe item by setting P=1.\n\nGiven that we want the FSM to allow the user to purchase another item, \nhow should we choose the next states from PAID?\n\nThe behavior that we want from PAID is identical to the behavior that\nwe defined from START.  The 35 cents already \ndeposited was used to pay for the item delivered, so the machine is\nno longer holding any of the user's money.\n\nWe can thus simply set the next states from PAID to be DIME when a \ndime is inserted and QUARTER when a quarter is inserted.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we make a decision intended primarily to simplify the\nlogic needed to build the lab.

In this case, the output P=0 in the\nstart state is not relevant, and we can merge the state START with\nthe state PAID.  The way that we handle P in the lab, we might\nfind it strange to have a ``paid'' light turn on before inserting any\nmoney, but keeping the design simple enough for a first lab exercise \nis more important.

So, given the constraints of the lab, there are only a few possible combinations of coins that the user could insert. \n\nTeacher: Exactly. For a total of 35 cents, the user could either insert a dime followed by a quarter, or a quarter followed by a dime. \n\nStudent : Ok, so we start in a START state and then transition to either DIME or QUARTER when the user inserts the first coin. With no previous coin, there's no need to specify a value for A . And since no money has been deposited yet, we set output P=0 in the START state. \n\nTeacher: That's right. Then we create DIME and QUARTER states corresponding to the user having entered one coin already. The first coin should be accepted but more money is needed, so both of these states output A=1 and P=0 . When a coin of the opposite type is entered, each state moves to PAID which is used for when the user has inserted enough money- 35 cents in this case. \n\nStudent: Ok, so what happens if the user makes a mistake and inserts more than one of the same type of coin? \n\nTeacher: We create REJECTD and REJECTQ states for when respectively too many dimes or quarters have been inserted already. In these cases A=0 and P=0 . If another dime is inserted while in REJECTD state then it will just stay in that state since A=0 . However if instead a quarter is inserted then it will move to PAID because now enough money has been inputted as specified by our table above.. \n\nStudent : Ok, I see. So after someone pays 35 cents and buys one item ,the FSM moves into PAID which delivers the item by setting P = 1 . If we want the FSM to allow another purchase however ,then we go back into START again which resets everything? \n\nTeacher : Yes exactly! The machine goes back into START after someone pays for an item so that they can pay for another item if they'd like using either coins with values 10 or 25 again"

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Picking the Representation}\n\nWe are now ready to choose the state representation for the lab FSM.\n\nWith five states, we need three bits of internal state.\n\nProf. Jones decided to leverage human meaning in assigning the\nbit patterns, as follows:\n\n{\n\nS_2& type of last coin inserted (0 for dime, 1 for quarter)\nS_1& more than one quarter inserted? (1 for yes, 0 for no)\nS_0& more than one dime inserted? (1 for yes, 0 for no)\n\n}\n\n\nThese meanings are not easy to apply to all of our states.  For example,\nin the PAID state, the last coin inserted may have been of either type,\nor of no type at all, since we decided to start our FSM in that state as \nwell.  However, for the other four states, the meanings provide a clear\nand unique set of bit pattern assignments, as shown to the right.  We\ncan choose any of the remaining four bit patterns (010, 011, 101, or 111)\nfor the PAID state.  In fact, { we can choose all of the remaining\npatterns} for the PAID state.  We can always represent any state\n\n\n\nstate& S_2S_1S_0  \nPAID& ???\nDIME& 000\nREJECTD& 001\nQUARTER& 100\nREJECTQ& 110\n\n\n\nwith more\nthan one pattern if we have spare patterns available.  Prof. Jones\nused this freedom to simplify the logic design.\n\nThis particular example is slightly tricky.  The four free patterns do\nnot share any single bit in common, so we cannot simply insert x's\ninto all {K-map} entries for which the next state is PAID.\nFor example, if we insert an x into the {K-map} for  S_2^+,\nand then choose a function for S_2^+ that produces a value of 1\nin place of the don't care, we must also produce a 1 in\nthe corresponding entry of the {K-map} for S_0^+.  Our options\nfor PAID include 101 and 111, but not 100 nor 110.  These latter\ntwo states have other meanings.\n\n\nLet's begin by writing a next-state table consisting mostly of bits,\nas shown to the right.  We use this table to write out a {K-map}\nfor S_2^+ as follows: any of the patterns that may be used for the\nPAID state obey the next-state rules for PAID.  Any next-state marked\nas PAID is marked as don't care in the {K-map},\n\n\n{cc|cc}\n&&{|c}{S_2^+S_1^+S_0^+}\nstate& S_2S_1S_0& T=0& T=1 \nPAID& PAID& 000& 100\nDIME& 000& 001& PAID\nREJECTD& 001& 001& PAID\nQUARTER& 100& PAID& 110\nREJECTQ& 110& PAID& 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsince we can\nchoose patterns starting with either or both values to represent our\nPAID state.  The resulting {K-map} appears to the far right.\nAs shown, we simply set S_2^+=T, which matches our\noriginal ``meaning'' for S_2.  That is, S_2 is the type of the\nlast coin inserted.\n\n\nBased on our choice for S_2^+, we can rewrite the {K-map} as\nshown to the right, with green italics and shading marking the\nvalues produced for the x's in the specification.  Each of these\nboxes corresponds to one transition into the PAID state.  By \nspecifying the S_2 value, we cut the number of possible choices\nfrom four to two in each case.  For those combinations in which the\nimplementation produces S_2^+=0, we must choose S_1^+=1, but\nare still free to leave S_0^+ marked as a don't care.  Similarly,\nfor those combinations in which the implementation produces S_2^+=1, \nwe must choose S_0^+=1, but\nare still free to leave S_1^+ marked as a don't care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe {K-maps} for S_1^+ and S_0^+ are shown to the right.\nWe have not given algebraic expressions for either, but have indicated\nour choices by highlighting the resulting replacements of don't care\nentries with the values produced by our expressions.\n\nAt this point, we can review the state patterns actually produced by\neach of the four next-state transitions into the PAID state.  From\nthe DIME state, we move into the 101 state when the user inserts a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarter.  The result is the same from the REJECTD state.  From the\nQUARTER state, however, we move into the 010 state when the user \ninserts a dime.  The result is the same from the REJECTQ state.  We\nmust thus classify both patterns, 101 and 010, as PAID states.  The\nremaining two patterns, 011 and 111, cannot\n\n\nbe reached from any of\nthe states in our design.  We might then try to leverage the fact\nthat the next-state patterns from these two states are not relevant \n(recall that we fixed the next-state patterns for all four of the \npossible PAID states) to further simplify our logic, but doing so \ndoes not provide any advantage (you may want to check our claim).\n\nThe final state table is shown to the right.  We have included the\nextra states at the bottom of the table.  We have specified the\nnext-state logic for these\n\n\n{cc|cc|cc}\n&&{|c|}{S_2^+S_1^+S_0^+}\nstate& S_2S_1S_0& T=0& T=1& A& P \nPAID1& 010& 000& 100& 1& 1\nPAID2& 101& 000& 100& 1& 1\nDIME& 000& 001& 101& 1& 0\nREJECTD& 001& 001& 101& 0& 0\nQUARTER& 100& 010& 110& 1& 0\nREJECTQ& 110& 010& 110& 0& 0 \nEXTRA1& 011& 000& 100& x& x\nEXTRA2& 111& 000& 100& x& x\n\n\n\nstates, but left the output bits as don't\ncares.

I was hoping I could ask you some questions about the finite state machine design examples we went over in class. \nTeacher : Of course, what would you like to know?\nStudent : Well, I was wondering if you could walk me through the process of designing a vending machine controller. \nTeacher : Certainly. So, when designing an FSM for a vending machine, it's important to first think about all of the different things that need to happen in order for the machine to function properly. For example, what needs to happen when someone inserts a coin? \nStudent : I see. So we need to take into account all of the possible inputs and outputs that could occur. \nTeacher : Exactly. Once we have a good understanding of all of the different states that need to be considered, we can start mapping out our design. \nStudent : Could you give me an example of how we would do that? \nTeacher : Sure. Let's say we have a three-state machine with states A, B, and C. State A represents when no coins have been inserted, state B represents when one coin has been inserted, and state C represents when two coins have been inserted. In this case, the input would be a coin being inserted into the machine, and the output would be whether or not the vending machine dispenses a product. \nStudent : Ok, I think I'm following so far. But how do we decide what state the machine should be in at any given time? \nTeacher: That's where encoders and decoders come in handy. Encoders help us encode our current state information into a format that can be read by our FSM while decoders do the reverse - they help us decode information from our FSM so that we can take appropriate action based on its current state . By using these components, we can design our vending machine controller so that it is able to keep track of its current state and respond accordingly to any input it receives .",

The output of the vending machine FSM is a 1 if a coin is dispensed, and a 0 otherwise.\n\nStudent : What's an encoder?\n\nTeacher: An encoder is a device that converts information from one form to another. In this case, it converts the state of the vending machine from idle to coin or dispense. \n\nStudent : What's a decoder? \n\nTeacher: A decoder is a device that converts information from one form to another. In this case, it converts the state of the vending machine from coin to dispense or idle. \n\n Student : So why do we need an encoder and decoder? Can't we just use one or the other? \n\n Teacher: You could just use an encoder or just use a decoder, but using both gives you more flexibility in your design. For example, you could use an encoder to encode the state of the vending machine as a binary number (0 for idle, 1 for coin, 2 for dispense), and then use a decoder to convert that back into its corresponding state (idle, coin, or dispense).

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Design of a Vending Machine}\n\nFor the next example, we design an FSM to control a simple vending machine.  \nThe machine accepts {U.S. coins}{Most countries have small \nbills or coins in demoninations suitable for vending machine prices, so think \nabout some other currency if you prefer.} as payment and offers a choice\nof three items for sale.\n\nWhat states does such an FSM need?  The FSM needs to keep track of how\nmuch money has been inserted in order to decide whether a user can \npurchase one of the items.  That information alone is enough for the\nsimplest machine, but let's create a machine with adjustable item\nprices.  We can use registers to hold the item prices, which \nwe denote P_1, P_2, and P_3.\n\nTechnically, the item prices are also part of the internal state of the \nFSM.  However,  we leave out discussion (and, indeed, methods) for setting\nthe item prices, so no state with a given combination of prices has any \ntransition to a state with a different set of item prices.\nIn other words, any given combination of item prices induces a subset \nof states that operate independently of the subset induced by a distinct \ncombination of item prices.  By abstracting away the prices in this way,\nwe can focus on a general design that allows the owner of the machine\nto set the prices dynamically.\n\n\nOur machine will not accept pennies, so let's have the FSM keep track of\nhow much money has been inserted as a multiple of 5 cents (one nickel).\nThe table to the right shows five types of coins, their value in \ndollars, and their value in terms of nickels.\n\nThe most expensive item in the machine might cost a dollar or two, so\nthe FSM must track at least 20 or 40 nickels of value.  Let's\n\n\n{l|c|c}\n{c|}{coin type}& value& # of nickels \nnickel&      0.05& 1\ndime&        0.10& 2\nquarter&     0.25& 5\nhalf dollar& 0.50& 10\ndollar&      1.00& 20\n\n\n\ndecide to\nuse six bits to record the number of nickels, which allows the machine\nto keep track of up to 3.15 (63 nickels).  We call the abstract\nstates { STATE00} through { STATE63}, and refer to a state with\nan inserted value of N nickels as { STATE{<}N{>}}.\n\nLet's now create a next-state table, as shown at the top of the next page.\nThe user can insert one of the five coin types, or can pick one of the \nthree items.  What should happen if the user inserts more money than the \nFSM can track?  Let's make the FSM reject such coins.  Similarly, if the \nuser tries to buy an item without inserting enough money first, the FSM \nmust reject the request.  For each of the possible input events, we add a \ncondition to separate the FSM states that allow the input event to \nbe processed as the user desires from those states that do not.  For example,\nif the user inserts a quarter, those states with N<59 transition to\nstates with value N+5 and accept the quarter.  Those states with\nN reject the coin and remain in { STATE{<}N{>}}.\n\n\n{c|l|c|l|c|c}\n&&& {|c}{final state}\n&&& {|c}{}& & release \ninitial state& {|c|}{input event}& condition& {|c}& & product \n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& no input& always& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& nickel inserted& N<63& { STATE{<}N+1{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& nickel inserted& N=63& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dime inserted& N<62& { STATE{<}N+2{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dime inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& quarter inserted& N<59& { STATE{<}N+5{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& quarter inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& half dollar inserted& N<54& { STATE{<}N+10{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& half dollar inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dollar inserted& N<44& { STATE{<}N+20{>}}& yes& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& dollar inserted& N& { STATE{<}N{>}}& no& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 1 selected& N{P_1}& { STATE{<}N-P_1{>}}& ---& 1\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 1 selected& N<P_1& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 2 selected& N{P_2}& { STATE{<}N-P_2{>}}& ---& 2\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 2 selected& N<P_2& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 3 selected& N{P_3}& { STATE{<}N-P_3{>}}& ---& 3\n{ STATE{<}N{>}}& item 3 selected& N<P_3& { STATE{<}N{>}}& ---& none\n\n\n\nWe can now begin to formalize the I/O for our machine.  Inputs include \ninsertion of coins and selection of items for purchase.  Outputs include\na signal to accept or reject an inserted coin as well as signals to release\neach of the three items.\n\n\nFor input to the FSM, we assume that a coin inserted in any given cycle \nis classified and delivered to our FSM using the three-bit representation \nshown to the right.\n\nFor item selection, we assume that the user has access to three buttons,\nB_1, B_2, and B_3, that indicate a desire to purchase the \ncorresponding item.\n\nFor output, the FSM must produce a signal A indicating whether a coin\nshould be accepted.  To control the release of items that have been purchased,\nthe FSM must produce the signals R_1, R_2, and R_3, corresponding\nto the re-\n\n\n{l|c}\n{c|}{coin type}& C_2C_1C_0 \nnone&        110\nnickel&      010\ndime&        000\nquarter&     011\nhalf dollar& 001\ndollar&      111\n\n\n\nlease of each item.  Since outputs in our class depend only on\nstate, we extend the internal state of the FSM to include bits for each of\nthese output signals.  The output signals go high in the cycle after\nthe inputs that generate them.  Thus, for example, the accept signal A\ncorresponds to a coin inserted in the previous cycle, even if a second\ncoin is inserted in the current cycle.  This meaning must be made clear to\nwhomever builds the mechanical system to return coins.\n\nNow we are ready to complete the specification.  How many states does the\nFSM have?  With six bits to record money inserted and four bits to \ndrive output signals, we have a total of 1,024 (2^) states!\nSix different coin inputs are possible, and the selection buttons allow\neight possible combinations, giving 48 transitions from each state.\nFortunately, we can use the meaning of the bits to greatly simplify\nour analysis.\n\nFirst, note that the current state of the coin accept bit and item\nrelease bits---the four bits of FSM state that control the outputs---have\nno effect on the next state of the FSM.  Thus, we can consider only the\ncurrent amount of money in a given state when thinking about the \ntransitions from the state.  As you have seen, we can further abstract\nthe states using the number N, the number of nickels currently held by \nthe vending machine.\n\nWe must still consider all 48 possible transitions from { STATE{<}N{>}}.\nLooking back at our abstract next-state table, notice that we had only\neight types of input events (not counting ``no input'').  If we\nstrictly prioritize these eight possible events, we can safely ignore\ncombinations.  Recall that we adopted a similar strategy for several \nearlier designs, including the ice cream dispenser in Notes Set 2.2 and\nthe keyless entry system developed in Notes Set 3.1.3.\n\nWe choose to prioritize purchases over new coin insertions, and to \nprioritize item 3 over item 2 over item 1.  These prioritizations\nare strict in the sense that if the user presses B_3, both other\nbuttons are ignored, and any coin inserted is rejected, regardless of\nwhether or not the user can actually purchase item 3 (the machine\nmay not contain enough money to cover the item price).\n\nWith the choice of strict prioritization, all transitions from all\nstates become well-defined.  We apply the transition rules in order of\ndecreasing priority,\nwith conditions, and with {don't-cares} for lower-priority inputs. \nFor example, for any of the 16 { STATE50}'s (remember that the four\ncurrent output bits do not affect transitions), the table below lists all\npossible transitions assuming that P_3=60, P_2=10, and P_1=35.\n\n{\n{ccccc|ccccc}\n&&&&& {|c}{next state}\ninitial state& B_3& B_2& B_1& C_2C_1C_0& state& A& R_3& R_2& R_1 \n{ STATE50}& 1&x&x& xxx& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&1&x& xxx& { STATE40}& 0& 0&1&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&1& xxx& { STATE15}& 0& 0&0&1\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 010& { STATE51}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 000& { STATE52}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 011& { STATE55}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 001& { STATE60}& 1& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 111& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n{ STATE50}& 0&0&0& 110& { STATE50}& 0& 0&0&0\n\n}\nNext, we need to choose a state representation.  But this task is \nessentially done: each output bit (A, R_1, R_2, and R_3) is\nrepresented with one bit in the internal representation, and the\nremaining six bits record the number of nickels held by the vending\nmachine using an unsigned representation.\n\nThe choice of a numeric representation for the money held is important,\nas it allows us to use an adder to compute the money held in\nthe next state.\n\n",

A truth table for our priority encoder appears on the \nleft below, with {K-maps} for each of the output bits on the right.\n\n\n{cccc|cc}\nB_3& B_2& B_1& B_0& P& S \n1&x&x&x& 1& 11\n0&1&x&x& 1& 10\n0&0&1&x& 1& 01\n0&0&0&1& 1& 00\n0&0&0&0& 0& xx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the {K-maps}, we extract the following equations:\n{eqnarray*}\nP &=& B_3 + B_2 + B_1 + B_0\nS_1 &=& B_3 + B_2\nS_0 &=& B_3 + {B_2}B_1\n{eqnarray*}\nwhich allow us to implement our encoder as shown to the right.\n\nIf we connect our buttons B_1, B_2, and B_3 to the priority \nencoder (and feed 0 into the fourth input), it produces a signal P \nindicating that the user is trying to make a purchase and a two-bit\nsignal S indicating which item the user wants.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to build logic to control the item release outputs R_1, R_2,\nand R_3.  An item should be released only when it has been selected \n(as indicated by the priority encoder signal S) and the vending machine\nhas enough money.  For now, let's leave aside calculation of the item \nrelease signal, which we call R, and focus on how we can produce the\ncorrect values of R_1, R_2, and R_3 from S and R.\n\nThe component to the right is a { decoder} with an enable input.  A \ndecoder takes an input signal---typically one coded as a binary number---and \nproduces one output for each possible value of the signal.  You may\nnotice the similarity with the structure of a mux: when the decoder\nis enabled (EN=1), each of the AND gates produces\n\n\n\n\n\none minterm of the input signal S.  In\nthe mux, each of the inputs is then included in\none minterm's AND gate, and the outputs of all AND gates are ORd together.\nIn the decoder, the AND gate outputs are the outputs of the decoder.\nThus, when enabled, the decoder produces exactly one 1 bit on its outputs.\nWhen not enabled (EN=0), the decoder produces all 0 bits.\n\nWe use a decoder to generate the release signals for the vending machine\nby connecting the signal S produced by the \npriority encoder to the decoder's S input and connecting the item\nrelease signal R to the decoder's EN input.  The outputs D_1,\nD_2, and D_3 then correspond to the individual item release \nsignals R_1, R_2, and R_3 for our vending machine.\n\n",

So, a priority encoder is a type of encoder that generates a signal whenever any of its input lines are active. The signal indicates the highest active input line. \n\nStudent : \nHow does it do that? \n\nTeacher : It does that by encoding the index of the highest active input as a two-bit unsigned number.

So, can you walk me through an example of how this works in our vending machine? \n\n Teacher: Let's say that button B1, B2, and B3 are all pressed simultaneously. That would mean that all three inputs are active. In this case, the priority encoder would generate a signal P indicating that the user is trying to make a purchase, and it would also encode 10 as the two-bit number S since B2 has the highest priority."

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Vending Machine Implementation}\n\n\nWe are now ready to implement the FSM to handle purchases, as shown to the \nright.  The current number of nickels, N, is stored in a register in the\ncenter of the diagram.  Each cycle, N is fed into a {6-bit} adder,\nwhich subtracts the price of any purchase requested in that cycle. \n\nRecall that we chose to record item prices in registers.  We avoid the \nneed to negate prices before adding them by storing the negated prices in\nour registers.  Thus, the value of register PRICE1 is -P_1, the\nthe value of register PRICE2 is -P_2, and the\nthe value of register PRICE3 is -P_3.\n\nThe priority encoder's S signal is then used to select the value of \none of these three registers (using a {24-to-6} mux) as the second\ninput to the adder.\n\nWe use the adder to execute a subtraction, so the carry out C_ \nis 1 whenever the value of N is at least as great as the amount \nbeing subtracted.  In that case, the purchase is successful.  The AND\ngate on the left calculates the signal R indicating a successful purchase,\nwhich is then used to select the next value of N using the {12-to-6}\nmux below the adder.  \n\nWhen no item selection buttons are pushed, P and thus R are both 0, \nand the mux below the adder keeps N unchanged in the next cycle.  \nSimilarly, if P=1 but N is\ninsufficient, C_ and thus R are both 0, and again N does\nnot change.  Only when P=1 and C_=1 is the purchase successful,\nin which case the price is subtracted from N in the next cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe signal R is also used to enable a decoder that generates the three\nindividual item release outputs.  The correct output is generated based on\nthe decoded S signal from the priority encoder, and all three output\nbits are latched into registers to release the purchased item in the next \ncycle.\n\nOne minor note on the design so far: by hardwiring C_ to 0, we created \na problem for items that cost nothing (0 nickels): in that case, C_ is\nalways 0.  We could instead store\n-P_1-1 in PRICE1 (and so forth) and feed P in to C_, but maybe\nit's better not to allow free items.\n\n\nHow can we support coin insertion?  Let's use the same adder to add\neach inserted coin's value to N.  The table at the right shows\nthe value of each coin as a {5-bit} unsigned number of nickels.\nUsing this table, we can fill in {K-maps} for each bit of V, as\nshown below.  Notice that we have marked the two undefined bit patterns\nfor the coin type C as don't cares in the {K-maps}.\n\n\n{l|c|c}\n{c|}{coin type}& C_2C_1C_0& V_4V_3V_2V_1V_0 \nnone&        110& 00000\nnickel&      010& 00001\ndime&        000& 00010\nquarter&     011& 00101\nhalf dollar& 001& 01010\ndollar&      111& 10100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the {K-maps} gives the following equations, which we\nimplement as shown to the right.\n\n{eqnarray*}\nV_4 &=& C_2C_0\nV_3 &=& {C_1}C_0\nV_2 &=& C_1C_0\nV_1 &=& {C_1}\nV_0 &=& {C_2}C_1\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can extend the design to handle coin insertion, as shown to the right\nwith new elements highlighted in blue.  The output of the coin value \ncalculator is extended with a leading 0 and then fed into a {12-to-6} mux.\nWhen a purchase is requested, P=1 and the mux forwards the item price to \nthe adder---recall that we chose to give purchases priority over coin\ninsertion.  When no purchase is requested, the value of any coin inserted\n(or 0 when no coin is inserted) is passed to the adder.\n\nTwo new gates have been added on the lower left.  First, let's verify that\npurchases work as before.  When a purchase is requested, P=1, so the\nNOR gate outputs 0, and the OR gate simple forwards R to control the\nmux that decides whether the purchase was successful, just as in our\noriginal design.\n\nWhen no purchase is made (P=0, and R=0), the adder adds the value of \nany inserted coin to N.  If the addition overflows, C_=1, and\nthe output of the NOR gate is 0.  Note that the NOR gate output is stored\nas the output A in the next cycle, so a coin that causes overflow in the\namount of money stored is rejected.  The OR gate also outputs 0, and N\nremains unchanged.  If the addition does not overflow, the NOR gate\noutputs a 1, the coin is accepted (A=1 in the next cycle), and \nthe mux allows the sum N+V to be written back as the new value of N.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tables at the top of the next page define all of the state variables,\ninputs, outputs, and internal signals used in the design, and list the\nnumber of bits for each variable.\n\n\n\n\n{|ccl|}\n{|r|}{{ FSM state}}\nPRICE1& 6& negated price of item 1 (-P_1)\nPRICE2& 6& negated price of item 2 (-P_2)\nPRICE3& 6& negated price of item 3 (-P_3)\nN& 6& value of money in machine (in nickels)\nA& 1& stored value of accept coin output\nR_1& 1& stored value of release item 1 output\nR_2& 1& stored value of release item 2 output\nR_3& 1& stored value of release item 3 output \n{|r|}{{ internal signals}}\nV& 5& inserted coin value in nickels\nP& 1& purchase requested (from priority encoder)\nS& 2& item # requested (from priority encoder)\nR& 1& release item (purchase approved) \n\n\n{|ccl|}\n{|r|}{{ inputs}}\nB_1& 1& item 1 selected for purchase\nB_2& 1& item 2 selected for purchase\nB_3& 1& item 3 selected for purchase\nC& 3& coin inserted (see earlier table \n& & for meaning) \n{|r|}{{ outputs}}\nA& 1& accept inserted coin (last cycle)\nR_1& 1& release item 1\nR_2& 1& release item 2\nR_3& 1& release item 3\n{|l|}{{ Note that outputs correspond one-to-one}}\n{|l|}{{ with four bits of FSM state.}} \n\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Design of a Game Controller}\n\nFor the next example, imagine that you are part of a team building a\ngame for children to play at Engineering Open House.\n\nThe game revolves around an old logic problem in which a farmer must\ncross a river in order to reach the market.  The farmer is traveling\nto the market to sell a fox, a goose, and some corn.  The farmer has\na boat, but the boat is only large enough to carry the fox, the goose,\nor the corn along with the farmer.  The farmer knows that if he leaves\nthe fox alone with the goose, the fox will eat the goose.  Similarly,\nif the farmer leaves the goose alone with the corn, the goose will \neat the corn.\n\nHow can the farmer cross the river?\n\nYour team decides to build a board illustrating the problem with\na river from top to bottom and lights illustrating the positions of \nthe farmer (always with the boat), the fox, the goose, and the\ncorn on either the left bank or the right bank of the river.\nEverything starts on the left bank, and the children can play \nthe game until they win by getting everything to the right bank or\nuntil they make a mistake.\n\nAs the ECE major on your team, you get to design the FSM!\n\n{choose a state representation}{step-repn}\n{calculate logic expressions}{step-logic}\n{implement with flip-flops and gates}{step-gates}\n\nSince the four entities (farmer, fox, goose, and corn) can be only\non one bank or the other, we can use one bit to represent the location\nof each entity.  Rather than giving the states names, let's just\ncall a state FXGC.  The value of F represents the location of the farmer,\neither on the left bank (F=0) or the right bank (F=1).  Using\nthe same representation (0 for the left bank, 1 for the right bank),\nthe value of X represents the location of the fox, G represents the\nlocation of the goose, and C represents the location of the corn.\n\n\nWe can now put together an abstract next-state table, as shown to\nthe right.  Once the player wins or loses, let's have the game indicate\ntheir final status and stop accepting requests to have the farmer cross\nthe river.  We can use a reset button to force the game back into the\noriginal state for the next player.\n\nNote that we have included conditions for some of the input events, as \nwe did previously\n\n\n{c|l|c|c}\ninitial state& {|c|}{input event}& condition& final state \nFXGC& no input& always& FXGC\nFXGC& reset & always& 0000\nFXGC& cross alone& always& XGC\nFXGC& cross with fox& F=X& GC\nFXGC& cross with goose& F=G& XC\nFXGC& cross with corn& F=C& XG\n\n\n\nwith the vending machine design.\n\nThe conditions here require that the farmer be on the same bank as any\nentity that the player wants the farmer to carry across the river.\n\nNext, we specify the I/O interface. \n\nFor input, the game has five buttons.  A reset button R forces the\nFSM back into the initial state.  The other four buttons cause the\nfarmer to cross the river: B_F crosses alone, B_X with the fox,\nB_G with the goose, and B_C with the corn.\n\nFor output, we need position indicators for the four entities, but let's\nassume that we can simply output the current state FXGC and have\nappropriate images or lights appear on the correct banks of the \nriver.  We also need two more indicators: W for reaching the winning\nstate, and L for reaching a losing state.\n\nNow we are ready to complete the specification.  We could use a strict\nprioritization of input events, as we did with earlier examples.  Instead,\nin order to vary the designs a bit, we use a strict prioritization among \nallowed inputs.  The reset button R has the highest priority, followed\nby B_F, B_C, B_G, and finally B_X.  However, only those buttons \nthat result in an allowed move are considered when selecting one button \namong several pressed in a single clock cycle.\n\n\nAs an example, consider the \nstate FXGC=0101.  The farmer is not on the same bank as the fox, nor\nas the corn, so the B_X and B_C buttons are ignored, leading to the\nnext-state table to the right.  Notice that B_G is accepted even if B_C\nis pressed because the farmer is not on the same\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0101& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0101& 0& 1& x& x& x& 1101\n0101& 0& 0& x& 1& x& 1111\n0101& 0& 0& x& 0& x& 0101\n\n\n\nbank as the corn.\nAs shown later, this approach to prioritization\nof inputs is equally simple in terms of implementation.  \n\n\nRecall that we want to stop the game when the player wins or loses.\nIn these states, only the reset button is accepted.  For example, the \nstate FXGC=0110 is a losing state because\n\n\n{cccccc|c}\nFXGC& R& B_F& B_X& B_G& B_C& F^+X^+G^+C^+ \n0110& 1& x& x& x& x& 0000\n0110& 0& x& x& x& x& 0110\n\n\n\nthe farmer\nhas left the fox with the goose on the opposite side of the river.\nIn this case, the player can reset the game, but other buttons\nare ignored.\n\nAs we have already chosen a representation, we now move on to implement\nthe FSM.  Let's begin by calculating the next state ignoring the\nreset button and the winning and losing states, as shown in the logic \ndiagram below.\n\n\n\nThe left column of XOR gates determines whether the farmer is on the same\nbank as the corn (top gate), goose (middle gate), and fox (bottom gate).\nThe output of each gate is then used to mask out the corresponding button:\nonly when the farmer is on the same bank are these buttons considered.\nThe adjusted button values are then fed into a priority encoder, which\nselects the highest priority input event according to the scheme that\nwe outlined earlier (from highest to lowest, B_F, B_C, B_G, and\nB_X, ignoring the reset button).  \n\nThe output of the priority encoder is then used to drive another column\nof XOR gates on the right in order to calculate the next state.\nIf any of the allowed buttons is pressed, the priority encoder \noutputs P=1, and the farmer's bank is changed.  If B_C is allowed\nand selected by the priority encoder (only when B_F is not pressed),\nboth the farmer and the corn's banks are flipped.  The goose and the fox\nare handled in the same way.\n\n\nNext, let's build a component to produce the win and lose signals.\nThe one winning state is FXGC=1111, so we simply need an AND gate.\nFor the lose signal L, we can fill in a {K-map} and derive an \nexpression, as shown to the right, then implement as shown in the logic\ndiagram to the far right.  For the {K-map}, remember that the player\nloses whenever the fox and the goose are on the same side of the river,\nbut opposite from the farmer, or whenever the goose and the corn are on\nthe same side of the river, but opposite from the farmer.\n\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\nL &=& F   +  X G +\n&& F   +  G C\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we complete our design by integrating the next-state\ncalculation and the win-lose calculation with a couple of muxes, as\nshown to the right.\n\nThe lower mux controls the final value of the next state: note that\nit selects between the constant state FXGC=0000 when the reset button R\nis pressed and the output of the upper mux when R=0.\n\nThe upper mux is controlled by W+L, and retains the current state\nwhenever either signal is 1.  In other words, once the player has won\nor lost, the upper mux prevents further state changes until the reset\nbutton is pressed.\n\nWhen R, W, and L are all 0, the next state is calculated\naccording to whatever buttons have been pressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Analysis of a Stoplight Controller}\n\nIn this example, we begin with a digital FSM design and analyze it to\nunderstand how it works and to verify that its behavior is appropriate.\n\nThe FSM that we analyze has been designed to control the stoplights\nat the intersection of two roads.  For naming purposes, we assume that one\nof the roads runs East and West (EW), and the second runs North and \nSouth (NS).  \n\nThe stoplight controller has two inputs, each of which \nsenses vehicles approaching from either direction on one of the two roads.\nThe input V^=1 when a vehicle approaches from either the East or the\nWest, and the input V^=1 when a vehicle approaches from either the\nNorth or the South.  These inputs are also active when vehicles are stopped\nwaiting at the corresponding lights.\n\nAnother three inputs, A, B, and C, control the timing behavior of the\nsystem; we do not discuss them here except as variables.\n\n\nThe outputs of the controller consist of two {2-bit} values, \nL^ and L^, that specify the light colors for the two roads.\nIn particular, L^ controls the lights facing East and West, and\nL^ controls the lights facing North and South.  The meaning of these\noutputs is given in the table to the right.\n\n\n{c|c}\nL& light color \n0x& red\n10& yellow\n11& green\n\n\n\nLet's think about the basic operation of the controller.\n\nFor safety reasons, the controller must ensure that the lights on one\nor both roads are red at all times.  \n\nSimilarly, if a road has a green light, the controller should \nshow a yellow light before showing a red light to give drivers some\nwarning and allow them to slow down.\n\nFinally, for fairness, the controller should alternate green lights\nbetween the two roads.\n\nNow take a look at the logic diagram below.\n\nThe state of the FSM has been split into two pieces: a {3-bit} \nregister S and a {6-bit} timer.  The timer is simply a binary \ncounter that counts downward and produces an output of Z=1 when it \nreaches 0.  Notice that the register S only takes a new value\nwhen the timer reaches 0, and that the Z signal from the timer\nalso forces a new value to be loaded into the timer in the next \ncycle.  We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by \ncycle basis as consisting of two types.  The first type simply\ncounts downward for a number of cycles while holding the register S\nconstant, while the second changes the value of S and sets the\ntimer in order to maintain the new value of S \nfor some number of cycles.\n\n\n\n3.45\n\n\nLet's look at the next-state logic for S, which feeds into the IN\ninputs on the {3-bit} register (S_2^+=IN_2 and so forth).  Notice \nthat none of the inputs to the FSM directly affect these values.  The\nstates of S thus act like a counter.  By examining the connections,\nwe can derive equations for the next state and draw a transition\ndiagram, as shown to the right.\n\nAs the figure shows, there are six states in the loop defined by the \nnext-state logic, with the two remaining states converging into the\nloop after a single cycle.\n\nLet's now examine the outputs for each\nstate in order to understand how the stoplight sequencing\nworks.\n\nWe derive equations for the outputs that control the lights, as shown\nto the right, then calculate values and colors for each\nstate, as shown to the far right.  For completeness, the table \nincludes the states outside of the desired loop.  The \nlights are all red in both of these states, which is necessary for safety.\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n\nS_2^+ &=& {S_2} + S_0\nS_1^+ &=& {S_2}  S_1\nS_0^+ &=& {S_2}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n{eqnarray*}\nL_1^ &=& S_2 S_1\nL_0^ &=& S_0\nL_1^ &=& S_2 {S_1}\nL_0^ &=& S_0\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\n{c|cc|cc}\n&&& EW& NS\n&&& light& light\nS& L^& L^& color& color \n000& 00& 00&    red&    red\n111& 11& 01&  green&    red\n110& 10& 00& yellow&    red\n010& 00& 00&    red&    red\n101& 01& 11&    red&  green\n100& 00& 10&    red& yellow \n001& 01& 01&    red&    red\n011& 01& 01&    red&    red\n\n\n\n\nNow let's think about how the timer works.  As we already noted, the\ntimer value is set whenever S enters a new state, but it can also be\nset under other conditions---in particular, by the signal F calculated\nat the bottom of the FSM logic diagram.  \n\n\nFor now, assume that F=0.  In this case, the timer is set only when\nthe state S changes, and we can find the duration of each state by\nanalyzing the muxes.  The bottom mux selects A when S_2=0, and \nselects the output of the top mux when S_2=1.  The top mux selects B\nwhen S_0=1, and selects C when S_0=0.  Combining these results,\nwe can calculate the duration of the next states of S when F=0, \nas shown in the table to the right.  We can then combine the next\nstate duration with our previous calculation of the state sequencing \n(also the order in the table) to obtain the durations of each state, also\nshown in the rightmost column of the table.\n\n\n{c|cc|cc}\n& EW& NS& next& current\n& light& light& state& state\nS& color& color& duration& duration \n000&    red&    red& A& C\n111&  green&    red& B& A\n110& yellow&    red& C& B\n010&    red&    red& A& C\n101&    red&  green& B& A\n100&    red& yellow& C& B \n001&    red&    red& A& ---\n011&    red&    red& A& ---\n\n\n\nWhat does F do?  Analyzing the gates that produce it gives \nF=S_1S_0{V^+{S_1}S_0{V^.  If we \nignore the two states outside of the main loop for S, the first term \nis 1 only when the lights are green on the East and West roads and the \ndetector for the North and South roads indicates that no vehicles are \napproaching.  Similarly, the second term is 1 only when the lights are \ngreen on the North and South roads and the detector for the East and \nWest roads indicates that no vehicles are approaching.\n\nWhat happens when F=1?  First, the OR gate feeding into the timer's\nLD input produces a 1, meaning that the timer loads a new value\ninstead of counting down.  Second, the OR gate controlling the lower\nmux selects the A input.  In other words, the timer is reset to A\ncycles, corresponding to the initial value for the green light states.\nIn other words, the light stays green until vehicles approach on \nthe other road, plus A more cycles.\n\nUnfortunately, the signal F may also be 1 in the unused states of S,\nin which case the lights on both roads may remain red even though cars\nare waiting on one of the roads.  To avoid this behavior, we must be \nsure to initialize the state S to one of the six states in the\ndesired loop.\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Specifying the Problem}\n\nLet's begin by specifying the problem that we want to solve.\nSay that we want to find the minimum value in a set of 10 integers.\nUsing the C programming language, we can write the following fragment of \ncode:\n\n\n{\n\naaaa=aaaa=\nint >values[10];    /* 10 integers--filled in by other code */\nint >idx;\nint >min\n\nmin = values[0];\nfor (idx = 1; 10 > idx; idx = idx + 1) {\n>  if (min > values[idx]) {\n>  >  min = values[idx];\n>  }\n}\n/* The minimum value from array is now in min. */\n\n}\n\n\nThe code uses array notation, which we have not used previously in our \nclass, so let's first discuss the meaning of the code.\n\nThe code uses three variables.\n\nThe variable { values} represents the 10 values in our set.\nThe suffix ``[10]'' after the variable name tells the compiler that\nwe want an array of 10 integers ({ int}) indexed from 0 to 9.\nThese integers can be treated as 10 separate variables, but can be\naccessed using the single name ``{ values}'' along with an index\n(again, from 0 to 9 in this case).\n\nThe variable { idx} holds a loop index that we use to examine each\nof the values one by one in order to find the minimum value in the set.\n\nFinally, the variable { min} holds the smallest known value as \nthe program examines each of the values in the set.\n\nThe program body consists of two statements.  \n\nWe assume that some other piece of code---one not shown here---has \ninitialized the 10 values in our set before the code above executes.\n\nThe first statement initializes the\nminimum known value ({ min}) to the value stored at index 0 in the \narray ({ values[0]}).\nThe second statement is a loop in which the variable { index} \ntakes on values from 1 to 9.  For each value, an { if} statement\ncompares the current\nknown minimum with the value stored in the array at index given by the\n{ idx} variable.  If the stored value is smaller, the current known \nvalue (again, { min}) is updated to reflect the program's\nhaving found a smaller value.  When the loop finishes all nine iterations,\nthe variable { min} holds the smallest value among the set of 10 \nintegers stored in the { values} array.\n\n\nAs a first step towards designing an FSM to implement the code, we transform\nthe code into a flow chart, as shown to the right.  The program again begins\nwith initialization, which appears in the second column of the flow chart.  \nThe loop in the program translates to the third column of the flow chart, \nand the { if} statement to the middle comparison and update \nof { min}.\n\nOur goal is now to design an FSM to implement the flow chart.  In order\nto do so, we want to leverage the same kind of abstraction that we used\nearlier, when extending our keyless entry system with a timer.  Although the\ntimer's value was technically also\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-flow-chart.eps,width=3.78in}}\n\n\npart of the FSM's state, we treated it\nas data and integrated it into our next-state decisions in only a couple\nof cases.\n\nFor our minimum value problem, we have two sources of data.  First, an\nexternal program supplies data in the form of a set of 10 integers.  If\nwe assume {32-bit} integers, these data technically form 320 input bits!\nSecond, as with the keyless entry system timer, we have data used internally\nby our FSM, such as the loop index and the current minimum value.  These\nare technically state bits.  For both types of data, we treat them\nabstractly as values rather than thinking of them individually as bits,\nallowing us to develop our FSM at a high-level and then to implement it \nusing the components that we have developed earlier in our course.\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Choosing Components and Identifying States}\n\nNow we are ready to design an FSM that implements the flow chart.\nWhat components do we need, other than our state logic?\nWe use registers and counters to implement the variables { idx}\nand { min} in the program.\nFor the array { values}, we use a {1632-bit} \nmemory.{We technically only need a {1032-bit} \nmemory, but we round up the size of the address space to reflect more\nrealistic memory designs; one can always optimize later.}\nWe need a comparator to implement the test for the { if} statement.\nWe choose to use a serial comparator, which allows us to illustrate again\nhow one logical high-level state can be subdivided into many actual states.\nTo operate the serial comparator, we make use of two shift registers that \npresent the comparator with one bit per cycle on each input, and a counter\nto keep track of the comparator's progress.\n\nHow do we identify high-level states from our flow chart?  Although\nthe flow chart attempts to break down the program into `simple' steps,\none step of a flow chart may sometimes require more than one state\nin an FSM.  Similarly, one FSM state may be able to implement several\nsteps in a flow chart, if those steps can be performed simultaneously.\nOur design illustrates both possibilities.\n\nHow we map flow chart elements into FSM states also depends to some \ndegree on what components we use, which is why we began with some discussion\nof components.  In practice, one can go back and forth between the two, \nadjusting components to better match the high-level states, and adjusting \nstates to better match the desired components.\n\nFinally, note that we are only concerned with high-level states, so we do \nnot need to provide details (yet) down to the level of individual clock \ncycles, but we do want to define high-level states that can be implemented\nin a fixed number of cycles, or at least a controllable number of cycles.\nIf we cannot specify clearly when transitions occur from an FSM state, we\nmay not be able to implement the state.\n\n\n\nNow let's go through the flow chart and identify states.  Initialization of\n{ min} and { idx} need not occur serially, and the result of the\nfirst comparison between { idx} and the constant 10 is known in advance,\nso we can merge all three operations into a single state, which we \ncall { INIT}.\n\nWe can also merge the updates of { min} and { idx} into a second\nFSM state, which we call { COPY}.  However, the update to { min} \noccurs only when the comparison ({ min > value[idx]}) is true.  \nWe can use logic to predicate execution of the update.  In other words, we \ncan use the output of the comparator, which is available after the comparator \nhas finished comparing the two values (in a high-level FSM state that we \nhave yet to define), to determine whether or not the register holding \n{ min} loads a new value in the { COPY} state.\n\nOur model of use for this FSM involves external logic filling the memory\n(the array of integer values), executing the FSM ``code,'' and then\nchecking the answer.  To support this use model, we create a FSM state \ncalled { WAIT} for cycles in which the FSM has no work to do.\nLater, we also make use of an external input signal { START} \nto start the FSM\nexecution.  The { WAIT} state logically corresponds to the ``START'' \nbubble in the flow chart.\n\n\nOnly the test for the { if} statement remains.  Using a serial\ncomparator to compare two {32-bit} values requires 32 cycles.\nHowever, we need an additional cycle to move values into our shift \nregisters so that the comparator can see the first bit.  Thus our\nsingle comparison operation breaks into two high-level states.  In the\nfirst state, which we call { PREP}, we copy { min} to one\nof the shift registers, copy { values[idx]} to the other shift\nregister, and reset the counter that measures the cycles needed for\nour serial comparator.  We then move to a second high-level state,\nwhich we call { COMPARE}, in which we feed one bit per cycle\nfrom each shift register to the serial comparator.  The { COMPARE} \nstate\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-flow-chart-states.eps,width=3.96in}}\n\n\nexecutes for 32 cycles, after which the comparator\nproduces the one-bit answer that we need, and we can move to the\n{ COPY} state.  The association between the flow chart and the\nhigh-level FSM states is illustrated in the figure shown to the right\nabove.\n\n\nWe can now also draw an abstract state diagram for our FSM, as shown\nto the right.  The FSM begins in the { WAIT} state.  After external\nlogic fills the { values} array, it signals the FSM to begin by\nraising the { START} signal.  The FSM transitions into the \n{ INIT} state, and in the next cycle into the { PREP} state.\nFrom { PREP}, the FSM always moves to { COMPARE}, where it\nremains for 32 cycles while the serial comparator executes a comparison.\nAfter { COMPARE}, the FSM moves to the { COPY}\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-state-diag.eps,width=3in}}\n\n\nstate, where\nit remains for one cycle.  The transition from { COPY} depends on\nhow many loop iterations have executed.  If more loop iterations remain,\nthe FSM moves to { PREP} to execute the next iteration.  If the\nloop is done, the FSM returns to { WAIT} to allow external logic\nto read the result of the computation.\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Laying Out Components}\n\n\nOur high-level FSM design tells us what our components need to be able to\ndo in any given cycle.  For example, when we load new values into the shift\nregisters that provide bits to the serial comparator, we always copy \n{ min} into one shift register and { values[idx]} into the second.\nUsing this information, we can put together our components and simplify our\ndesign by fixing the way in which bits flow between them.\n\nThe figure at the right shows how we can organize our components.\nAgain, in practice, one goes back and forth thinking about states,\ncomponents, and flow from state to state.  In these notes, we \npresent only a completed design.\n\nLet's take a detailed look at each of the components.\n\nAt the upper left of the figure is a {4-bit} binary counter called\n{ IDX} to hold the { idx}\nvariable.  The counter can be reset to 0 using the { RST} input.\nOtherwise, the { CNT} input controls whether or not the counter\nincrements its value.  With this counter design, we can force { idx} \nto 0 in the { WAIT} state and then count upwards in the { INIT}\nand { COPY} states.\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/part3-min-components.eps,width=3.84in}}\n\n\nA memory labeled { VALUES} to hold the array { values} appears \nin the upper right of\nthe figure.  The read/write control for the memory is hardwired to 1 (read)\nin the figure, and the data input lines are unattached.  To integrate \nwith other logic that can operate our FSM, we need to add more \ncontrol logic to allow writing into the memory and to attach the data\ninputs to something that provides the data bits.  The address input of\nthe memory comes always from the { IDX} counter value; in other words,\nwhenever we access this memory by making use of the data output lines,\nwe read { values[idx]}.\n\nIn the middle left of the figure is a {32-bit} register for the \n{ min} variable.  It has a control input { LD} that \ndetermines whether or not it loads a new value at the end of the clock\ncycle.  If a new value is loaded, the new value always corresponds to\nthe output of the { VALUES} memory, { values[idx]}.  Recall\nthat { min} always changes in the { INIT} state, and may change\nin the { COPY} state.  But the new value stored in { min}\nis always { values[idx]}. \nNote also that when the FSM completes its task, the result of the \ncomputation is left in the { MIN} register for external logic to\nread (connections for this purpose are not shown in the figure).\n\nContinuing downward in the figure, we see two right shift registers\nlabeled { A} and { B}.  Each has a control input { LD}\nthat enables a parallel load.  Register { A} loads from register\n{ MIN}, and register { B} loads from the memory data output\n({ values[idx]}).  These loads are needed in the { PREP}\nstate of our FSM.  When { LD} is low, the shift registers\nsimply shifts to the right.  The serial output { SO} makes the\nleast significant bit of each shift register available.  Shifting\nis necessary to feed the serial comparator in the { COMPARE} state.\n\nBelow register { A} is a {5-bit} binary counter called { CNT}.\nThe counter is used to control the serial comparator in the { COMPARE}\nstate.  A reset input { RST} allows it to be forced to 0 in the \n{ PREP} state.  When the counter value is exactly zero, the \noutput { Z} is high.\n\n\n\nThe last major component is the serial comparator, which is based on the\ndesign developed in Notes Set 3.1.  The two bits to be compared in \na cycle come from shift registers { A} and { B}.  The first\nbit indicator comes from the zero indicator of counter { CNT}.\nThe comparator actually produces two outputs ({ Z1} and { Z0}),\nbut the meaning of the\n{ Z1} output by itself is { A > B}.  In the diagram,\nthis signal has been labeled { THEN}.\n\nThere are two additional elements in the figure that we have yet to discuss.\nEach simply compares the value in a register with a fixed constant and \nproduces a {1-bit} signal.  When the FSM finishes an iteration of\nthe loop in the { COPY} state, it must check the loop condition\n({ 10 > idx}) and move either to the { PREP} state or, when\nthe loop finishes, to the { WAIT} state to let the external logic\nread the answer from the { MIN} register.  The loop is done when the\ncurrent iteration count is nine, so we compare { IDX} with nine to\nproduce the { DONE} signal.  The other constant comparison is between\nthe counter { CNT} and the value 31 to produce the { LAST} signal,\nwhich indicates that the serial comparator is on its last cycle of \ncomparison.  In the cycle after { LAST} is high, the { THEN} \noutput of the comparator indicates whether or not { A > B}.\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Control and Data}\n\nOne can think of the components and the interconnections between them\nas enabling the movement of data between registers, while the high-level \nFSM controls which data move from register to register in each cycle.  \n\nWith this model in mind, we call the components and interconnections\nfor our design the { datapath}---a term that we will see again when\nwe examine the parts of a computer in the coming weeks.\n\nThe datapath requires several inputs to control the operation of the\ncomponents---these we can treat as outputs of the FSM.\nThese signals allow the FSM to control the motion of data in the \ndatapath, so we call them { control signals}.\n\nSimilarly, the datapath produces several outputs that we can treat\nas inputs to the FSM.\n\nThe tables below summarize the control signals (left) and outputs (right)\nfrom the datapath for our FSM.\n\n[t]\n{|c|l|}\ndatapath& \ninput& {|c|} \n{ IDX.RST}& reset { IDX} counter to 0\n{ IDX.CNT}& increment { IDX} counter\n{ MIN.LD}& load new value into { MIN} register\n{ A.LD}& load new value into shift register { A}\n{ B.LD}& load new value into shift register { B}\n{ CNT.RST}& reset { CNT} counter \n\n\n[t]\n{|c|l|c|}\ndatapath& &\noutput& {|c|}& based on \n{ DONE}& last loop iteration finished& { IDX = 9}\n{ LAST}& serial comparator executing& { CNT = 31}\n&    last cycle&\n{ THEN}& { if} statement condition true& { A > B} \n{}\n{}\n\n\n\nUsing the datapath controls signals and outputs, we can now write a more\nformal state transition table for the FSM, as shown below.\n\nThe ``actions'' column of the table\nlists the changes to register and counter values\nthat are made in each of the FSM states.  The notation used to represent\nthe actions is called { register transfer language} ({ RTL}).\nThe meaning of an individual action is similar to the meaning of the \ncorresponding statement from our C code or from the flow chart.\nFor example, in the { WAIT} state, ``{ IDX  0}''\nmeans the same thing as ``{ idx = 0;}''.  In particular, both mean\nthat the value currently stored in the { IDX} counter is overwritten \nwith the number 0 (all 0 bits).\n\n\n\nThe meaning of RTL is slightly different from the usual interpretation of\nhigh-level programming languages, however, in terms of when the actions\nhappen.  A list of C statements is generally executed one at a time.\n\nIn contrast, the entire list of RTL actions\n\n\n{|c|l|c|c|}\nstate& {|c|}{actions (simultaneous)}& condition& next state \n{ WAIT}& { IDX}  0 (to read { VALUES[0]} in { INIT})& { START}& { INIT} \n&& {{ START}}& { WAIT} \n{ INIT}& { MIN}  { VALUES[IDX]} ({ IDX} is 0 in this state)& (always)& { PREP} \n& { IDX}  { IDX} + 1& & \n{ PREP}& { A}  { MIN}& (always)& { COMPARE}\n& { B}  { VALUES[IDX]}& &\n& { CNT}  0& & \n{ COMPARE}& run serial comparator& { LAST}& { COPY}\n&& {{ LAST}}& { COMPARE} \n{ COPY}& { THEN}: { MIN}  { VALUES[IDX]}& { DONE}& { WAIT} \n& { IDX}  { IDX} + 1& {{ DONE}}& { PREP} \n\n\n\nfor an FSM state is executed\nsimultaneously, at the end of the clock cycle.  As you know, an FSM moves \nfrom its current state into a new state at the end of every clock cycle,\nso actions during different cycles usually are associated with different \nstates.\nWe can, however, change the value in more than one register at the end \nof the same clock cycle, so we can execute more than one RTL action in\nthe same state, so long as the actions do not exceed the capabilities\nof our datapath (the components must be able to support the simultaneous \nexecution of the actions).  Some care must be taken with states that \nexecute for more than one cycle to ensure that repeating the \nRTL actions is appropriate.  In our design, only the { WAIT} and\n{ COMPARE} states execute for more than one cycle.  The { WAIT}\nstate resets the { IDX} counter repeatedly, which causes no problems.\nThe { COMPARE} statement has no RTL actions---all of the shifting,\ncomparison, and counting activity needed to do its work occurs within \nthe datapath itself.\n\nOne additional piece of RTL syntax needs explanation.  In the { COPY}\nstate, the first action begins with ``{ THEN}:,'' which means that the \nprefixed RTL action occurs only when the { THEN} signal is high.\nRecall that the { THEN} signal indicates that the comparator has\nfound { A > B}, so the equivalent C code is ``{ if (A > B) \n{min = values[idx]}}''.\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{State Representation and Logic Expressions}\n\nLet's think about the representation for the FSM states.  The FSM has \nfive states, so we could use as few as three flip-flops.  Instead, we choose\nto use a { one-hot encoding}, in which any valid bit pattern has exactly\none 1 bit.  In other words, we use five flip-flops instead of three,\nand our states are represented with the bit patterns 10000, 01000, 00100,\n00010, and 00001.\n\nThe table below shows the mapping from each high-level state to \nboth the five-bit encoding for the state as well as the six control signals \nneeded for the datapath.  For each state, the values of the control signals\ncan be found by examining the actions necessary in that state.\n\n{\n{|c|c|cccccc|}\nstate& { S_4S_3S_2S_1S_0}& { IDX.RST}& { IDX.CNT}& { MIN.LD}& { A.LD}& { B.LD}& { CNT.RST} \n{ WAIT}& { 1 0 0 0 0}& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\n{ INIT}& { 0 1 0 0 0}& 0& 1& 1& 0& 0& 0\n{ PREP}& { 0 0 1 0 0}& 0& 0& 0& 1& 1& 1\n{ COMPARE}& { 0 0 0 1 0}& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0\n{ COPY}& { 0 0 0 0 1}& 0& 1& { THEN}& 0& 0& 0 \n{}\n\n}\n\nThe { WAIT} state needs to set { IDX} to 0 but need not affect \nother register or counter values, so { WAIT} produces a 1 only for\n{ IDX.RST}.  The { INIT} state needs to load { values[0]} into \nthe { MIN} register while simultaneously incrementing the { IDX}\ncounter (from 0 to 1), so { INIT} produces 1s for { IDX.CNT}\nand { MIN.LD}.  The { PREP} state loads both shift registers\nand resets the counter { CNT} by producing 1s for { A.LD},\n{ B.LD}, and { CNT.RST}.  The { COMPARE} state does not\nchange any register values, so it produces all 0s.  Finally, the { COPY}\nstate increments the { IDX} counter while simultaneously loading a\nnew value into the { MIN} register.  The { COPY} state produces 1\nfor { IDX.CNT}, but must use the signal { THEN} coming from the\ndatapath to decide whether or not { MIN} is loaded.\n\n\n\nThe advantage of a one-hot encoding becomes obvious when we write\nequations for the six control signals and the next-state logic, as shown\nto the right.  \n\nImplementing the logic to complete our design now requires only a handful \nof small logic gates.\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{ IDX.RST} & = & { S}_4\n{ IDX.CNT} & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0\n{ MIN.LD} & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0  { THEN}\n{ A.LD} & = & { S}_2\n{ B.LD} & = & { S}_2\n{ CNT.RST} & = & { S}_2\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n{ S}_4^+ & = & { S}_4  { START} + { S}_0  { DONE}\n{ S}_3^+ & = & { S}_4  { START}\n{ S}_2^+ & = & { S}_3 + { S}_0  { DONE}\n{ S}_1^+ & = & { S}_2 + { S}_1  { LAST}\n{ S}_0^+ & = & { S}_1  { LAST}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n\nNotice that the terms in each control signal can be read directly from \nthe rows of the state table and OR'd together.  The terms in each of the\nnext-state equations represent the incoming arcs for the corresponding\nstate.  For example, the { WAIT} state has one self-loop (the first\nterm) and a transition arc coming from the { COPY} state when the\nloop is done.\n\nThese expressions complete our design.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's a more efficient way of doing things. \nStudent: I see. Thanks for clarifying that!"

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Physical Design, Sensors, and Timing}\n\n\nTo begin, let's review the FSM that we designed earlier for keyless \nentry.  The state transition diagram for our design is replicated to \nthe right.\n\nThe four states are labeled with state bits and output bits,\nS_1S_0/DRA, where D indicates that the driver's door should\nbe unlocked, R indicates that the rest of the doors should be\nunlocked, and A indicates that the alarm should be on.\n\nTransition arcs in the diagram are labeled with concise versions of \nthe inputs ULP (using don't cares), where U represents an unlock\nbutton, L represents a lock button, and P represents a panic \nbutton.\n\nIn this design, once a user presses the panic button P, the alarm\nsounds until the user presses the\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-trans-diag-brief.eps,width=4.2in}\n\n\nlock button L to turn it off.\nInstead of sounding the alarm indefinitely, we might want to turn\nthe alarm off after a fixed amount of time.  In other words, after \nthe system has been in the ALARM state for, say, thirty or sixty seconds,\nwe might want to move back to the LOCKED state even if the user has\nnot pushed the lock button.  The blue annotation in the diagram indicates\nthe arc that we must adjust.  But thirty or sixty seconds is a large \nnumber of clock cycles, and our FSM must keep track of the time.\nDo we need to draw all of the states?\n\nInstead of following the design process that we outlined earlier, let's\nthink about how we can modify our existing design to incorporate the new\nfunctionality.  In order to keep track of time, we use a binary counter.\n\nLet's say that we want our timeout to be T cycles.\n\nWhen we enter the alarm state, we want to set the counter's value \nto T-1, then let the counter count down until it reaches 0, at \nwhich point a timeout occurs.\n\nTo load the initial value, our counter should have a parallel load \ncapability that sets the counter value when input LD=1.  When LD=0,\nthe counter counts down. \n\nThe counter also has an output Z that indicates that the counter's \nvalue is currently zero, which we can use to indicate a timeout on\nthe alarm.\n\nYou should be able to build such a counter based on what you have learned\nearlier in the class.  Here, we will assume that we can just make use of\nit.\n\nHow many bits do we need in our counter?  The answer depends on T.\nIf we add the counter to our design, the state of the counter is \ntechnically part of the state of our FSM, but we can treat it\nsomewhat abstractly.  For example, we only plan to make use of the \ncounter value in the ALARM state, so we ignore the counter bits in the\nthree other states.  In other words, S_1S_0=10 means that the system \nis in the LOCKED state regardless of the counter's value.\n\n\nWe expand the ALARM state into T separate states based on the value\nof the counter.  As shown to the right, we name the states ALARM(1) \nthrough ALARM(T).  All of these alarm states use S_1S_0=01, but\nthey can be differentiated using a ``timer'' (the counter value).\n\nWe need to make design decisions about how the arcs entering and\nleaving the ALARM state in our original design should be used once\nwe have incorporated the timeout.  As a first step, we decide that\nall arcs entering ALARM from other states now enter ALARM(1).  \nSimilarly, if the user presses the panic button P in any of the\nALARM(t) states, the system returns to ALARM(1).  Effectively, \npressing the panic button resets the timer.\n\nThe only arc leaving the ALARM state goes to the LOCKED state on \nULP=x10.  We replicate this arc for all ALARM(t) states: the\nuser can push the lock button at any time to silence the alarm.\n\nFinally, the self-loop back to the ALARM state on ULP=x00 becomes\nthe countdown arcs in our expanded states, taking ALARM(t) to ALARM(t+1),\nand ALARM(T) to LOCKED.\n\nNow that we have a complete specification for the extended design, we\ncan implement it.  We want to reuse our original design as much as possible,\nbut we have three new features that must be considered.  First, when\nwe enter the ALARM(1) state, we need to set the counter value to T-1.\nSecond, we need the counter value to count downward while in the ALARM\nstate.  Finally, we need to move back to the LOCKED state when a timeout\noccurs---that is, when the counter reaches zero.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-alarm-expansion.eps,width=1.75in}\n\n\nThe first problem is fairly easy.  Our counter supports parallel load,\nand the only value that we need to load is T-1, so we apply the constant\nbit pattern for T-1 to the load inputs and raise the LD input whenever\nwe enter the ALARM(1) state.  In our original design, we chose to enter\nthe ALARM state whenever the user pressed P, regardless of the other\nbuttons.  Hence we can connect P directly to our counter's LD input.\n\nThe second problem is handled by the counter's countdown functionality.\nIn the ALARM(t) states, the counter will count down each cycle, moving\nthe system from ALARM(t) to ALARM(t+1).\n\nThe last problem is slightly trickier, since we need to change S_1S_0.\nNotice that S_1S_0=01 for the ALARM state and S_1S_0=00 for the LOCKED\nstate.  Thus, we need only force S_0 to 0 when a timeout occurs.\nWe can use a single {2-to-1} multiplexer for this purpose.  The\n``0'' input of the mux comes from the original S_0^+ logic, and the\n``1'' input is a constant 0.  All other state logic remains unchanged.  \nWhen does a timeout occur? \n\nFirst, we must be in the ALARM(T) state, so S_1S_0=01 and the \ncounter's Z output is raised.  Second, the input combination must\nbe ULP=xx0---notice that both ULP=x00 and ULP=x10 return to \nLOCKED from ALARM(T).  A single, four-input AND gate thus suffices to\nobtain the timeout signal, {S_1}S_0Z, which we connect \nto the select input of the mux between the S_0^+ logic and the\nS_0 flip-flop.\n\nThe extension thus requires only a counter, a mux, and a gate, as shown below.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/ke-alarm-exp-impl.eps,width=2.65in}}\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Let's take a look at the course syllabus together and see what topics you are struggling with the most. \nStudent: Great. I'm having difficulties grasping the concept of clock cycles and how to design a finite state machine that keeps track of time. \nTeacher: That's a great question! Let's start with clock cycles first. A clock cycle is defined as the period of time between two successive pulses of equal value in an electronic circuit. In other words, it's the amount of time it takes for a signal to complete one full cycle. As for designing a finite state machine that keeps track of time, we can do this by incorporating a binary counter into our design. \nStudent: Would it be possible to go over an example with me? \nTeacher: Of course! Let's say we have a four-bit counter that counts down from 15 to 0. In order to load the initial value into our counter, we need to set LD=1 when we enter our alarm state. When LD=0, our counter will count down until it reaches 0, which indicates that our timeout has occurred. To handle this in our design, we expand our alarm state into T separate states based on the value of our counter. So in this case, T would be 16 since we have a four-bit counter (24). We name these states Alarm(1) through Alarm(16). All 16 alarm states use S_1S_0=01 but they can be differentiated using our timer (the binary counter value). Once we have expanded out all 16 alarm states like this, implementing our design should be fairly straightforward! \nStudent: That makes much more sense now!

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Serialization: General Strategy}\n\nIn previous notes, we discussed and illustrated the development of bit-sliced\nlogic, in which one designs a logic block to handle one bit of a multi-bit\noperation, then replicates the bit slice logic to construct a design for \nthe entire operation.  We developed ripple carry adders in this way in \nNotes Set 2.3 and both unsigned and 2's complement comparators in \nNotes Set 2.4.\n\n\nAnother interesting design strategy is { serialization}: rather than \nreplicating the bit slice, we can use flip-flops to store the bits passed\nfrom one bit slice to the next, then present the stored bits { to the\nsame bit slice} in the next cycle.  Thus, in a serial design, we only\nneed one copy of the bit slice logic!  The area needed for a serial design\nis usually much less than for a bit-sliced design, but such a design is\nalso usually slower.  After illustrating the general design strategy,\nwe'll consider these tradeoffs more carefully\nin the context of a detailed example.\n\n\nRecall the general bit-sliced design approach, as illustrated to the right.\n\nSome number of copies of the logic for a single bit slice are connected\nin sequence.  Each bit slice accepts P bits of operand input and\nproduces Q bits of external output.  Adjacent bit slices receive\nan additional M bits of information from the previous bit slice\nand pass along M bits to the next bit slice, generally using some\nrepresentation chosen by the designer.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/gen-slice-comp.eps,width=3.8in}\n\n\nThe first bit slice is initialized\nby passing in constant values, and some calculation may be performed\non the final bit slice's results to produce R bits more external output.\n\n\n\nWe can transform this bit-sliced design to a serial design with a single\ncopy of the bit slice logic, M+Q flip-flops, and M gates (and sometimes\nan inverter).  The strategy is illustrated on the right below.  A single\ncopy of the bit slice operates on one set of P external input bits \nand produces one set of Q external output bits each clock cycle.  In\nthe design shown, these output bits are available during the next \ncycle, after they have been stored in the flip-flops. \nThe M bits to be passed to the ``next'' bit slice are also \nstored in flip-flops,\nand in the next cycle are provided back to the same physical bit slice\nas inputs.  The first cycle of a multi-cycle operation\nmust be handled slightly differently, so we\nadd selection logic and an control signal, F.  For the first cycle, we\napply F=1, and the initial values are passed into the bit slice.  \nFor all other bits, we apply F=0, and the values stored in the flip-flops\nare returned to the bit slice's inputs.  After all bits have passed through\nthe bit slice---after N cycles for an {N-bit} design---the\nfinal M bits are stored in the flip-flops, and the results are calculated\nby the output logic. \n\n{\n\n{file=part3/figs/init-ser-slice.eps,width=1.4in}\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ser-slice-comp.eps,width=3.25in}\n\n}\n\nThe selection logic merits explanation.  Given that the original design\ninitialized the bits to constant values (0s or 1s), we need only simple\nlogic for selection.  The two drawings on the left above illustrate \nhow {B_i}, the complemented flip-flop output for a bit i, can be\ncombined with the first-cycle signal F to produce an appropriate input\nfor the bit slice.  Selection thus requires one extra gate for each of \nthe M inputs, and we need an inverter for F if any of the initial \nvalues is 1.\n\n\n",

Serialization is a design strategy where you use flip-flops to store the bits passed from one bit slice to the next, then present the stored bits to the same bit slice in the next cycle.\nStudent : Follow up question - why is this method usually slower than replicated bit slice designs? \nTeacher: Because in a serial design, we only need one copy of the bit slice logic while replicating bit slice designs would require multiple copies.\nStudent : Ah, I see. Would you mind providing an example to help me understand this concept better? \nTeacher: Let's say we have a 4-bit adder designed using serialization. The first bit slice operates on external input bits P and produces output Q which is stored in flip-flops. The next clock cycle, those stored output bits Q are provided back as inputs to the same physical bit slice along with M new input bits. This process repeats until all N input bits have gone through the adder and we can calculate our final result. \nStudent : That makes sense. So with each clock cycle, we're essentially operating on 1 bit at a time as opposed to multiple bits with replicated designs? \nTeacher: Yes, that's correct. \nStudent : One more question - what are some advantages and disadvantages of using this design strategy? \nTeacher: Generally speaking, serial designs require less area but they are usually slower than their replicated counterparts.",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Serialization: Comparator Example}\n\n\nWe now apply the general strategy to a specific example, our bit-sliced\nunsigned comparator from Notes Set 2.4.  The result is shown to the right.\nIn terms of the general model, the single comparator bit slice accepts P=2\nbits of inputs each cycle, in this case a single bit from each of the two\nnumbers being compared, presented to the bit slice in increasing order\nof significance.  The bit slice produces no external output other than\nthe final result (Q=0).  Two bits (M=2) are produced each cycle by \nthe bit slice and stored\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ser-compare.eps,width=3.5in}\n\n\ninto flip flops B_1 and B_0.  These bits\nrepresent the relationship between the two numbers compared so far\n(including only the bit already seen by the comparator bit slice).\nOn the first cycle, when the least significant bits of A and B are\nbeing fed into the bit slice, we set F=1, which forces the C_1 \nand C_0 inputs of the bit slice to 0 independent of the values stored\nin the flip-flops.  In all other cycles, F=0, and the NOR gates\nset C_1=B_1 and C_0=B_0.  Finally, after N cycles for an {N-bit}\ncomparison, the output logic---in this case simply wires, as shown \nin the dashed box---places the result of the comparison on \nthe Z_1 and Z_0 outputs (R=2 in the general model).  \nThe result is encoded in the \nrepresentation defined for constructing the bit slice (see Notes Set 2.4,\nbut the encoding does not matter here).\n\n\nHow does the serial design compare with the bit-sliced design?\n\nAs an estimate of area, let's count gates.  Our optimized \ndesign is replicated to the right for convenience.  \n\nEach bit slice requires six {2-input} gates and two inverters.  \n\nAssume that each \nflip-flop requires eight {2-input} gates and two inverters,\nso the serial design overall requires 24 gates\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/comparator-opt-nn.eps,width=4.1in}\n\n\nand six inverters to handle any number of bits.\n\nThus, for any number of bits N, the serial design is smaller\nthan the bit-sliced design, and the benefit grows with N.\n\nWhat about performance?  In Notes Set 2.4, we counted gate delays for \nour bit-sliced design.  The path from A or B to the outputs is\nfour gate delays, but the C to Z paths are all two gate delays.\nOverall, then, the bit-sliced design requires 2N+2 gate delays \nfor N bits.  What about the serial design?\n\nThe performance of the serial design is likely to be much worse\nfor three reasons.\n\nFirst, all paths in the design matter, not just the paths from bit\nslice to bit slice.  None of the inputs can be assumed to be available\nbefore the start of the clock cycle, so we must consider all paths\nfrom input to output.  \n\nSecond, we must also count gate delays for the\nselection logic as well as the gates embedded in the flip-flops.\n\nFinally, the result of these calculations may not matter, since the\nclock speed may well be limited by other logic elsewhere in the\nsystem.  If we want a common clock for all of our logic, the clock\nmust not go faster than the slowest element in the entire system, or\nsome of our logic will not work properly.\n\nWhat is the longest path through our serial comparator?\n\nLet's assume that \nthe path through a flip-flop is eight gate delays, with four on each \nside of the clock's rising edge.  The inputs A and B are\nlikely to be driven by flip-flops elsewhere in our system, so\nwe conservatively count four gate delays to A and B and\nfive gate delays to C_1 and C_0 (the extra one comes from\nthe selection logic).  The A and B paths thus dominate inside\nthe bit slice, adding four more gate delays to the outputs Z_1\nand Z_0.  Finally, we add the last four gate delays to flip\nthe first latch in the flip-flops for a total of 12 gate delays.\n\nIf we assume that our serial comparator limits the clock frequency\n(that is, if everything else in the system can use a faster clock),\nwe take 12 gate delays per cycle, or 12N gate delays to compare\ntwo {N-bit} numbers.\n\nYou might also notice that adding support for 2's complement is no \nlonger free.  We need extra logic to swap the A and B inputs\nin the cycle corresponding to the sign bits of A and B.  In\nother cycles, they must remain in the usual order.  This extra\nlogic is not complex, but adds further delay to the paths.\n\nThe bit-sliced and serial designs represent two extreme points in \na broad space of design possibilities.  Optimization of the entire\nN-bit logic function (for any metric) represents a third extreme.\nAs an engineer, you should realize that you can design systems\nanywhere in between these points as well.  At the end of Notes Set 2.4,\nfor example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares \ntwo bits at a time.  In general, we can optimize logic for any \nnumber of bits and then apply multiple copies of the resulting\nlogic in space (a generalization of the bit-sliced approach),\nor in time (a generalization of the serialization approach),\nor in a combination of the two.\n\nSometimes these tradeoffs may happen at a higher level.\nAs mentioned in Notes Set 2.3, computer software uses \nthe carry out of an adder to perform addition of larger \ngroups of bits (over multiple clock cycles)\nthan is supported by the processor's adder hardware.\n\nIn computer system design, engineers often design hardware elements\nthat are general enough to support this kind of extension in software.\n\nAs a concrete example of the possible tradeoffs,\nconsider a serial comparator design based on the {2-bit} slice variant.\n\nThis approach leads to a serial design with 24 gates and 10 inverters, \nwhich is not much\nlarger than our earlier serial design.  In terms of gate delays,\nhowever, the new design is identical, meaning that we finish a comparison\nin half the time.  More realistic area and timing metrics show\nslightly more difference between the two designs.  These differences can \ndominate the \nresults if we blindly scale the idea to handle more bits without \nthinking carefully about the design.  Neither many-input gates\nnor gates driving many outputs work well in practice.\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Finite State Machines}\n\nA { finite state machine} (or { FSM}) is a model for understanding\nthe behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a\nfinite set of states, moving between these states in response to\nexternal inputs, and producing external outputs.  In any given state,\na particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this \ncombination is called a { transition rule}.\n\nAn FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of \npossible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules,\nand methods for calculating outputs.  \n\nWhen an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be\nrepresented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must\nbe translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.\n\nFor a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words,\ngiven any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits,\na transition must be defined from that state to another state \n(transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops}, \nare acceptable).\n\nAnd, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces\nto Boolean logic expressions.\n\nIn this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations,\nin which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.\n\nIn this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and\nanalyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next\nfew weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control\nlogic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections\nbetween FSMs and software and will make some connections with other\nareas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital \ncontrol systems.\n\nThe table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical \nkeyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the\nstates rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each\nstate---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states.\nThe description of the states in the first column is an optional element\noften included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying\nthe states needed for the design.\nA list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in\nthe list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.\n\nBy including outputs for each state,\nwe implicitly assume that outputs depend only on\nthe state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail\nlater in these notes (see ``Machine Models''), \nbut will make the assumption throughout our class.\n\n\n\n{\n\nmeaning& state& driver's door& other doors& alarm on \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& locked& locked& no\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& unlocked& locked& no\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& unlocked& unlocked& no\nalarm sounding& ALARM& locked& locked& yes\n\n}\n\n\n\nAnother tool used with FSMs is the { next-state table} (sometimes\ncalled a { state transition table}, or just a { state table}), \nwhich maps the current state and input combination into the next state of \nthe FSM.  The abstract variant shown below outlines desired behavior at\na high level, and is often ambiguous, incomplete, and even inconsistent.\nFor example, what happens if a user pushes two buttons?  What happens\nif they push unlock while the alarm is sounding?  These questions \nshould eventually be considered.  However, we can already start to see \nthe intended use of the design: starting from a locked car, a user\ncan push ``unlock'' once to gain entry to the driver's seat, or push\n``unlock'' twice to open the car fully for passengers.  To lock the\ncar, a user can push the ``lock'' button at any time.  And, if a user\nneeds help, pressing the ``panic'' button sets off an alarm. \n\n\n\n{\n\nstate& action/input& next state \nLOCKED& push ``unlock''& DRIVER\nDRIVER& push ``unlock''& UNLOCKED\n(any)& push ``lock''& LOCKED\n(any)& push ``panic''& ALARM\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nA { state transition diagram} (or { transition diagram}, or\n{ state diagram}),\nas shown to the right, illustrates the\ncontents of the next-state table graphically, with each state drawn\nin a circle, and arcs between states labeled with the input combinations\nthat cause these transitions from one state to another.\n\nPutting the FSM design into this graphical form does not solve the\nproblems with the abstract model.  The questions that we asked\nin regard to the next-state table remain unanswered.\n\nImplementing an FSM using digital logic requires that we translate\nthe design into bits, eliminate any ambiguity, and complete the\nspecification.  How many internal bits should we use?  What are the\npossible input values, and how are their meanings represented in bits? \nWhat are the possible output values, and how are their meanings\nrepresented in bits?  We will consider these questions for several\nexamples in the coming weeks.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-abs-trans-diag.eps,width=3.45in}\n\n\nFor now, we simply define answers for our example design, the keyless\nentry system.  Given four states, we need at \nleast _2(4)=2 bits of internal state, which we\nstore in two flip-flops and call S_1S_0.  The table below lists input\nand output signals and defines their meaning. \n\n{\n\noutputs&D& driver door; 1 means unlocked\n&R& other doors (remaining doors); 1 means unlocked\n&A& alarm; 1 means alarm is sounding\ninputs& U& unlock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& L& lock button; 1 means it has been pressed\n& P& panic button; 1 means it has been pressed\n\n}\n\nWe can now choose a representation for our states and rewrite the list\nof states, using bits both for the states and for the outputs.  We\nalso include the meaning of each state for clarity in our example.\nNote that we can choose the internal representation in any way.  Here\nwe have matched the D and R outputs when possible to simplify\nthe output logic needed for the implementation.  The order of states\nin the list is not particularly important, but should be chosen for\nconvenience and clarity (including transcribing bits into to {K-maps}, \nfor example).\n\n{\n\n& & & driver's door& other doors& alarm on\nmeaning& state& S_1S_0& D& R& A \nvehicle locked& LOCKED& 00& 0& 0& 0\ndriver door unlocked& DRIVER& 10& 1& 0& 0\nall doors unlocked& UNLOCKED& 11& 1& 1& 0\nalarm sounding& ALARM& 01& 0& 0& 1\n\n}\n\n\n\nWe can also rewrite the next-state table in terms of bits.  We use\nGray code order on both axes, as these orders make it more \nconvenient to use {K-maps}.  The values represented in this table \nare the next FSM state given the current state S_1S_0 and the\ninputs U, L, and P.  Our symbols for the next-state bits\nare S_1^+ and S_0^+.  The ``+'' superscript\nis a common way of expressing\nthe next value in a discrete series, here induced by the use of\nclocked synchronous logic in implementing the FSM.  In other words,\nS_1^+ is the value of S_1 in the next clock cycle, and S_1^+\nin an FSM implemented as a digital system is a Boolean expression\nbased on the current state and the inputs.  For our example problem, we\nwant to be able to write down expressions for S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P) \nand S_1^+(S_1,S_0,U,L,P), as well as expressions for the \noutput logic D(S_1,S_0), R(S_1,S_0), and A(S_1,S_0). \n\n\n{\n{c|cccccccc}\ncurrent state & {|c}{ULP}\nS_1S_0& 000& 001& 011& 010& 110& 111& 101& 100 \n00& 00& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 10\n01& 01& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 01\n11& 11& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11\n10& 10& 01& 01& 00& 00& 01& 01& 11 \n\n}\n\n\nIn the process of writing out the next-state table, \nwe have made decisions for all of the questions that we asked earlier\nregarding the abstract state table.  These decisions are also reflected\nin the complete state transition diagram shown to the right.\nThe states have been extended with state bits and output bits,\nas S_1S_0/DRA.\nYou should recognize that we can\nalso leave some questions unanswered by placing x's (don't cares)\ninto our table.  However, you should also understand at this point\nthat any implementation will produce bits, not x's, so we must be\ncareful not to allow arbitrary choices unless any of the choices\nallowed is indeed acceptable for our FSM's purpose.  We will discuss\nthis process and the considerations necessary as we cover more FSM\ndesign examples.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/ke-trans-diag.eps,width=4.2in}\n\n\nWe have deliberately omitted calculation of expressions for the\nnext-state variables S_1^+ and S_0^+,\nand for the outputs D,\nR, and A.

A counter in which all flip-flops do \nutilize the same clock\nsignal is called a { synchronous counter}.  \n\nExcept for a brief introduction to other types of counters in the\nnext section, our class focuses entirely on clocked synchronous designs,\nincluding counters.\n\n {The definition ignores transition\n arcs resulting from functionalit such as a reset signal that\n forces the counter back into an initial state, \n\n\nThe design of synchronous counter circuits is a fairly straightforward\nexercise given the desired cycle of output patterns. \n\nThe task can be more complex if the internal state bits\nare allowed to differ from the output bits, so for now\nwe assume that output Z_i is equal to internal bit S_i.\nNote that distinction between internal states and outputs is necessary \nif any output pattern appears more than once in the desired cycle. \n\nThe cycle of states shown to the right corresponds to the\nstates of a {3-bit} binary counter.  The numbers in the states\nrepresent both internal state bits S_2S_1S_0 and output bits Z_2Z_1Z_0.\nWe transcribe this diagram into the next-state table shown on the left below.\nWe then write out {K-maps} for\nthe next state bits S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+, as shown to the right,\nand use the {K-maps} to find expressions for these variables in\nterms of the current state.\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/lec16-9.eps,width=1.5in}\n\n\n{\n\n{ccc|ccc}\nS_2& S_1& S_0& S_2^+& S_1^+& S_0^+ \n0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1\n0& 0& 1& 0& 1& 0\n0& 1& 0& 0& 1& 1\n0& 1& 1& 1& 0& 0\n1& 0& 0& 1& 0& 1\n1& 0& 1& 1& 1& 0\n1& 1& 0& 1& 1& 1\n1& 1& 1& 0& 0& 0\n\n\n\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s2.eps,width=1in}\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s1.eps,width=1in}\n{file=part3/figs/sbin3-s0.eps,width=1in} {-10pt}\n{eqnarray*}\nS_2^+ =& {S_2}S_1S_0+S_2{S_1}+S_2{S_0} &= S_2(S_1S_0) \nS_1^+ =& S_1{S_0}+{S_1}S_0 &= S_1{S_0} \nS_0^+ =& {S_0} &= S_0 \n{eqnarray*}\n\n}\n\nThe first form of the expression for each next-state variable is\ntaken directly from the corresponding {K-map}.  We have rewritten\neach expression to make the emerging pattern more obvious.\n\nWe can also derive the pattern intuitively by asking the following:\n\ngiven a binary counter in state S_{N-1}S_{N-2} S_{j+1}S_jS_{j-1}\nS_1S_0, when does S_j change in the subsequent state?  The answer,\nof course, is that S_j changes when all of the\nbits below S_j are 1.  Otherwise, S_j remains the\nsame in the next state.  We thus \nwrite S_j^+=S_j (S_{j-1} S_1S_0) and\nimplement the counter as shown below for a {4-bit} design.\nNote that the \nusual order of\noutput bits along the bottom is reversed in the figure, with the most\nsignificant bit at the right rather than the left.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/ser-gating.eps,width=4.5in}}\n\nThe calculation of the left inputs to the XOR gates in the counter \nshown above is performed with a series of two-input AND gates.  Each \nof these gates AND's\nanother flip-flop value into the product.  This\napproach, called { serial gating}, implies that an {N-bit}\ncounter requires more than {N-2} gate delays\nto settle into the next state.  An alternative approach, called\n{ parallel gating}, calculates each input independently with a\nsingle logic gate, as shown below.  The blue inputs to the AND gate\nfor S_3 highlight the difference from the previous figure (note that\nthe two approaches differ only for bits S_3 and above).\nWith parallel gating, the \n{ fan-in} of the gates (the number of inputs)\nand the { fan-out} of the flip-flop outputs (number of other gates\ninto which an output feeds) grow with the size of the counter.  \nIn practice, large counters use a combination of these two approaches.\n\n{{file=part3/figs/par-gating.eps,width=4.5in}}\n\n\n",

In a { Moore machine}, outputs depend only on\nthe internal state bits of the FSM (the values stored in the flip-flops).\nIn a { Mealy machine}, outputs\nmay be expressed as functions both of internal state and FSM inputs.\n\nAs we illustrate shortly, the benefit of using input signals to calculate\noutputs (the Mealy machine model) is that input bits effectively serve \nas additional system state, which means that the number of internal \nstate bits can be reduced.\n\nThe disadvantage of including input signals in the expressions for \noutput signals is that timing characteristics of input signals may not\nbe known, whereas an FSM designer may want to guarantee certain\ntiming characteristics for output signals.\n\nIn practice, when such timing guarantees are needed, the designer simply\nadds state to the FSM to accommodate the need, and the problem is solved.\n\nThe coin-counting FSM that we designed for our class' lab assignments,\nfor example, \nrequired that we use a Moore machine model to avoid sending the\nservo controlling the coin's path an output pulse that was too short\nto enforce the FSM's decision about which way to send the coin.\n\nBy adding more states to the FSM, we were able to hold the servo in\nplace, as desired.\n\nWhy are we protecting you from the model used in practice?\n\nFirst, timing issues add complexity to a topic that is complex enough \nfor an introductory course.\n\nAnd, second, most software FSMs are Moore machines, so the abstraction\nis a useful one in that context, too.\n\nIn many design contexts, the timing issues implied by a Mealy model\ncan be relatively simple to manage.  When working in a single clock\ndomain, all of the input signals come from flip-flops in the same \ndomain, and are thus stable for most of the clock cycle.  Only rarely\ndoes one need to keep additional state to improve timing characteristics\nin these contexts.  In contrast, when interacting across clock domains,\nmore care is sometimes needed to ensure correct behavior.\n\nWe now illustrate the state reduction benefit of the Mealy machine\nmodel with a simple example, an FSM that recognizes the \npattern of a 0 followed by a 1 on a single input and outputs\na 1 when it observes the pattern.\n\nAs already mentioned,\nMealy machines often require fewer flip-flops.\nIntuitively, the number of combinations of states and\ninputs is greater than the number of combinations of states alone, and\nallowing a function to depend on inputs reduces the number of internal\nstates needed.  \n\nA Mealy implementation of the FSM appears on the left below, and\nan example timing diagram illustrating the FSM's behavior is shown on\nthe right.\n\nThe machine shown below occupies state A when the last bit seen was a 0, and\nstate B when the last bit seen was a 1.\n\nNotice that the transition arcs in the state diagram\nare labeled with two values instead\nof one.  Since outputs can depend on input values as well as state,\ntransitions in a Mealy machine are labeled with input/output\ncombinations, while states are labeled only with their internal bits\n(or just their names, as shown below).  Labeling states with outputs\ndoes not make sense for a Mealy machine, since outputs may vary\nwith inputs.\n\nNotice that the outputs indicated on any given transition\nhold only until that transition is taken (at the rising clock edge), as is\napparent in the timing diagram.  When inputs are asynchronous, \nthat is,\nnot driven by the same clock signal, output pulses from a Mealy\nmachine can be arbitrarily short, which can lead to problems.\n\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/lec17-3.eps,width=5in}}\n\n\n\nFor a Moore machine, we must create a special state in which the\noutput is high.  Doing so requires that we split state B into two\nstates, a state C in which the last two bits seen were 01, and a\nstate D in which the last two bits seen were 11.  Only state C\ngenerates output 1.  State D also becomes the starting state for the\nnew state machine.  The state diagram on the left below illustrates \nthe changes, using the transition diagram style that we introduced \nearlier to represent Moore machines.\nNotice in the associated timing diagram that the output pulse lasts a\nfull clock cycle.\n\n\n\n{{file=part3/figs/lec17-4.eps,width=5in}}\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It consists of flip-flops that are connected together in such a way that the output of one flip-flop is the input of the next flip-flop. The output of the last flip-flop in the chain is fed back to the input of the first flip-flop, so that all of the flip-flops are clocked at the same time. \n\nStudent : What are some applications for synchronous counters?\n\nTeacher : Synchronous counters can be used for various purposes, such as keeping track of time or counting events. For example, a synchronous counter could be used to keep track of how many seconds have elapsed since an event occurred, or to count how many times a particular event has occurred. \n\nStudent : What are some advantages and disadvantages of using a synchronous counter as opposed to an asynchronous counter?\n\nTeacher : Some advantages of using a synchronous counter include that they are easier to design and implement than asynchronous counters, and they tend to be more accurate than asynchronous counters.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Formats and Fields*}\n\nThe LC-3 ISA \nemploys fixed-length instructions and a load-store architecture, two\naspects that help to reduce the design space to a manageable set of\nchoices.  In a general ISA design, many other options exist for\ninstruction formats.\n\nRecall the idea of separating the bits of an instruction into\n(possibly non-contiguous) fields.  One of the fields must contain an\nopcode, which specifies the type of operation to be performed by the\ninstruction.  In the {LC-3} ISA, most opcodes specify both\nthe type of operation and the types of arguments to the operation.  \nMore generally, many addressing modes are possible for\neach operand, and we can think of the bits\nthat specify the addressing mode as a separate field, known as the\n{ mode} field.  \n\nAs a simple example, the {LC-3's} ADD and AND instructions \ncontain a {1-bit} mode field that specifies whether the second\noperand of the ADD/AND comes from a register or is an immediate value.\n\nSeveral questions must be answered in order to define the possible\ninstruction formats for an ISA.  First, are instructions fixed-length\nor variable-length?  Second, how many addresses are needed for each\ninstruction, and how many of the addresses can be memory addresses?\nFinally, what forms of addresses are possible for each operand?\nFor example, can one use\nfull memory addresses or only limited offsets relative to a register?\n\nThe answer to the first question depends on many factors, but several\nclear advantages exist for both answers.  { Fixed-length\ninstructions} are easy to fetch and decode.  A processor knows in\nadvance how many bits must be fetched to fetch a full instruction;\nfetching the opcode and mode fields in order to decide how many more\nbits are necessary to complete the instruction may require more than\none cycle.  Fixing the time necessary for instruction fetch also\nsimplifies pipelining.  Finally, fixed-length instructions simplify\nthe datapath by restricting instructions to the size of the bus and\nalways fetching properly aligned instructions.  As an example of this\nsimplification, note that the {LC-3} ISA does not support \naddressing for individual bytes, only for {16-bit} words.\n\n{ Variable-length instructions} also have benefits, however.\nVariable-length encodings allow more efficient encodings, saving both\nmemory and disk space.  A register transfer operation, for example,\nclearly requires fewer bits than addition of values at two direct\nmemory addresses for storage at a third.  Fixed-length instructions\nmust be fixed at the length of the longest possible instruction,\nwhereas variable-length instructions can use lengths appropriate to\neach mode.  The same tradeoff has another form in the sense that\nfixed-length ISAs typically eliminate many addressing modes in order\nto limit the size of the instructions.  Variable-length instructions\nthus allow more flexibility; indeed, extensions to a variable-length\nISA can incorporate new addressing modes that require longer\ninstructions without affecting the original ISA.\n\nFor example, the maximum length of x86 instructions has grown from six \nbytes in 1978 (the 8086 ISA) to fifteen bytes in today's version of the\nISA.\n\n\n\n\nMoving to the last of the three questions posed for instruction format\ndefinition, operand address specification,\nwe explore a range of answers developed over the last few\ndecades.  Answers are usually chosen based on the number of bits\nnecessary, and we use this metric to organize the possibilities.  The\nfigure below separates approaches into two dimensions: the vertical\ndimension divides addressing into registers and memory, and the\nhorizontal dimension into varieties within each type.\n\n{{file=part4/figs/lec23-1.eps,width=4in}}\n\nAs a register file contains fewer registers than a memory does words,\nthe use of register operands rather than memory addresses reduces the\nnumber of bits required to specify an operand.  The {LC-3} ISA\nuses a restricted set of addressing modes to stay within the limit\nimposed by the use of {16-bit} instructions.  Both\nregister and memory addresses, however, admit a wide range of\nimplementations.\n\n{ Implicit operands} of either type require no additional bits for\nthe implicit address.  The {LC-3} procedure call instruction, JSR,\nfor example, stores the return address in R7.  No bits in the JSR \nencoding name the R7 register; R7 is used implicitly for every JSR\nexecuted.\n\nSimilarly, the procedure call instructions in many ISAs push the \nreturn address onto a stack using an implicit register for the top \nof stack pointer.\n\nMemory addresses can also be implicitly equated to other memory\naddresses.  An increment instruction operating on a memory address, for\nexample, implicitly writes the result back to the same address.  \n\nAt the opposite extreme, an instruction may include a full address,\neither to any register in the register file or to any address in the \nmemory.  The term { general-purpose registers} indicates that \nregisters are used in any operation.\n\n{ Special-purpose registers}, in contrast, split the register file\nand allow only certain registers to be used in each operation.  For\nexample, the Motorola 680x0 series, used in early Apple\nMacintosh computers, provides distinct sets of address and data\nregisters.  Loads and stores use the address registers; arithmetic,\nlogic, and shift operations use the data registers.  As a result, \neach instruction\nselects from a smaller set of registers and thus requires fewer bits\nin the instruction to name the register for use.\n\nAs full memory addresses require many more bits than full register\naddresses, a wider range of techniques has been employed to reduce the\nlength.  ``Zero page'' addresses, as defined in the 6510 (6502) ISA\nused by Commodore PET's,{My computer in junior high school.}\nC64's,{My computer in high school.} and VIC 20's, prefixed a\none-byte address with a zero byte, allowing shorter instructions when\nmemory addresses fell within the first 256 memory locations.  Assembly\nand machine language programmers made heavy use of these locations to\nproduce shorter programs.  \n\nRelative addressing is quite common in the {LC-3} ISA, in which many\naddresses are PC-relative.  Typical commerical ISAs also make use of\nrelative addressing.  The Alpha ISA, for example, has a PC-relative form of\nprocedure call with a {21-bit} offset (plus or minus a megabyte),\nand the x86 ISA has a ``short'' form of branch instructions that\nuses an {8-bit} offset.\n\nSegmented memory is a form of relative addressing that uses a register\n(usually implicit) to provide the high bits of an address and an\nexplicit memory address (or another register) to provide the low bits.\nIn the early x86 ISAs, for example, {20-bit} addresses are\nfound by adding a {16-bit} segment register extended with four\nzero bits to a {16-bit} offset.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Addressing Architectures*}\n\nOne question remains for the definition of instruction formats: how\nmany addresses are needed for each instruction, and how many of the\naddresses can be memory addresses?  The first part of this question\nusually ranges from zero to three, and is rarely allowed to go\nbeyond three.  The answer to the second part determines the {\naddressing architecture} implemented by an ISA.  We now illustrate the\ntradeoffs between five distinct addressing architectures through the\nuse of a running example, the assignment X=AB+C/D.\n\nA binary operator requires two source operands and one destination\noperand, for a total of three addresses.  The ADD instruction, for\nexample, has a { {3-address}} format:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B,C>; M[A]  M[B] + M[C]\n>or>ADD>R1,R2,R3>; R1  R2 + R3\n{-6pt}\n\nIf all three addresses can be memory addresses, the ISA is dubbed a\n{ memory-to-memory architecture}.  Such architectures may have\nsmall register sets or even lack a register file completely.  To\nimplement the assignment, we assume the availability of two memory\nlocations, T1 and T2, for temporary storage:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>MUL>T1,A,B>; T1  M[A] * M[B]\n>DIV>T2,C,D>; T2  M[C] / M[D]\n>ADD>X,T1,T2>; X  M[T1] + M[T2]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment requires only three instructions to implement, but each\ninstruction contains three full memory addresses, and is thus quite long.\n\nAt the other extreme is the { load-store architecture} used by the\n{LC-3} ISA.  In a load-store architecture, only\nloads and stores can use memory addresses; all other operations use\nonly registers.  As most instructions use only registers, this type of\naddressing architecture is also called a { register-to-register\narchitecture}.  The example assignment translates to the code shown below,\nwhich assumes that R1, R2, and R3 are free for use (the instructions\nare { NOT} {LC-3} instructions, but rather a generic assembly\nlanguage for a load-store architecture). \n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>LD>R2,B>; R2  M[B]\n>MUL>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 * R2\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>LD>R3,D>; R3  M[D]\n>DIV>R2,R2,R3>; R2  R2 / R3\n>ADD>R1,R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nEight instructions are necessary, but no instruction requires more\nthan one full memory address, and several use only register addresses,\nallowing the use of shorter instructions.  The need to move data in\nand out of memory explicitly, however, also requires a reasonably\nlarge register set, as is available in the ARM, Sparc, Alpha, and IA-64\nISAs.  \n\nArchitectures that use other combinations of memory and register\naddresses with {3-address} formats are not named.  Unary\noperators and transfer operators require only one source operand, thus\ncan use a {2-address} format (for example, NOT A,B).  Binary operations\ncan also use { {2-address}} format if one operand is implicit,\nas in the following instructions:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>A,B>; M[A]  M[A] + M[B]\n>or>ADD>R1,B>; R1  R1 + M[B]\n{-6pt}\n\nThe second instruction, in which one address is a register and the\nsecond is a memory address, defines a { register-memory\narchitecture}.  As shown by the code on the next page, \nsuch architectures strike a balance\nbetween the two architectures just discussed.\n\n\n\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>R1,A>; R1  M[A]\n>MUL>R1,B>; R1  R1 * M[B]\n>LD>R2,C>; R2  M[C]\n>DIV>R2,D>; R2  R2 / M[D]\n>ADD>R1,R2>; R1  R1 + R2\n>ST>R1,X>; M[X]  R1\n{-6pt}\n\nThe assignment now requires six instructions using at most one memory\naddress each; like memory-to-memory architectures, register-memory\narchitectures use relatively few registers.  Note that two-register\noperations are also allowed.  Intel's x86 ISA is a register-memory\narchitecture.\n\nSeveral ISAs of the past{The 6510/6502 as well, if memory\nserves, as the 8080, Z80, and Z8000, which used to drive parlor video\ngames.}  used a special-purpose register called the accumulator for\nALU operations, and are called { accumulator architectures}.  The\naccumulator in such architectures is implicitly both a source and the\ndestination for any such operation, allowing a { {1-address}}\nformat for instructions, as shown below.\n\n{-6pt}\n=WW=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>>ADD>B>; ACC  ACC + M[B]\n>or>ST>E>; M[E]  ACC\n{-6pt}\n\nAccumulator architectures strike the same balance as register-memory\narchitectures, but use fewer registers.  Note that memory location X\nis used as a temporary storage location as well as the final storage\nlocation in the following code:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWW=WW,WW,WW=\n>LD>A>; ACC  M[A]\n>MUL>B>; ACC  ACC * M[B]\n>ST>X>; M[X]  ACC\n>LD>C>; ACC  M[C]\n>DIV>D>; ACC  ACC / M[D]\n>ADD>X>; ACC  ACC + M[X]\n>ST>X>; M[X]  ACC\n{-6pt}\n\nThe last addressing architecture that we discuss is rarely used for\nmodern general-purpose processors, but may be familiar to\nyou because of its historical use in scientific and engineering calculators.\n\nA { stack architecture}\nmaintains a stack of values and draws all ALU operands from this\nstack, allowing these instructions to use a { {0-address}}\nformat.  A special-purpose stack pointer (SP) register points to the\ntop of the stack in memory, and operations analogous to load ({\npush}) and store ({ pop}) are provided to move values on and off\nthe stack.  To implement our example assignment, we first transform it\ninto postfix notation (also called reverse Polish notation):\n\n{-6pt}\n=\n>A  B  *  C  D  /  +\n{-6pt}\n\nThe resulting sequence of symbols transforms on a one-to-one basis\ninto instructions for a stack architecture:\n\n{-6pt}\n=WWWW=WW=; M[SP+1]  M[SP] + M[SP + 1], SP  SP + 1WW=AB+C/DW=AB+C/DW=\n>PUSH>A>; SP  SP - 1, M[SP]  M[A]>A\n>PUSH>B>; SP  SP - 1, M[SP]  M[B]>B>A\n>MUL>>; M[SP+1]  M[SP+1] * M[SP], SP  SP + 1>AB\n>PUSH>C>; SP  SP - 1, M[SP]  M[C]>C>AB\n>PUSH>D>; SP  SP - 1, M[SP]  M[D]>D>C>AB\n>DIV>>; M[SP+1]  M[SP+1] / M[SP], SP  SP + 1>C/D>AB\n>ADD>>; M[SP+1]  M[SP+1] + M[SP], SP  SP + 1>AB+C/D\n>POP>X>; M[X]  M[SP], SP  SP + 1\n{-6pt}\n\nThe values to the right are the values on the stack, starting with the\ntop value on the left and progressing downwards, { after the\ncompletion of each instruction}.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Special-purpose registers are dedicated registers used by the CPU to store certain data. \nStudent: What types of data do they store?\nTeacher: They can store data such as the program counter, processor status register, and stack pointer. \nStudent: What is the program counter? \nTeacher: The program counter is a special-purpose register that stores the address of the next instruction to be executed by the CPU. \nStudent: So it's like a pointer? \nTeacher: Yes, you can think of it as a pointer to the next instruction. \nStudent: What is the processor status register? \nTeacher: The processor status register is a special-purpose register that contains all status bits as well as a mode bit indicating whether the processor is operating in user mode or privileged (operating system) mode. \nStudent: And what exactly are status bits? \nTeacher: Status bits are bits that indicate whether certain conditions are true or false. For example, there could be a bit that indicates whether an interrupt is pending. \nStudent: Okay, that makes sense.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Reduced Instruction Set Computers*}\n\nBy the mid-1980's, the VAX architecture dominated the workstation and\nminicomputer markets, which included most universities.  Digital\nEquipment Corporation, the creator of the VAX, was second only to IBM\nin terms of computer sales.  VAXen, as the machines were called, used\nmicroprogrammed control units and supported numerous addressing modes\nas well as complex instructions ranging from ``square root'' to\n``find roots of polynomial equation.''\n\nThe impact of increasingly dense integrated circuit technology had\nbegun to have its effect, however, and in view of increasing processor\nclock speeds, more and more programmers were using high-level\nlanguages rather than writing assembly code.  Although assembly\nprogrammers often made use of the complex VAX instructions, compilers\nwere usually unable to recognize the corresponding high-level language\nconstructs and thus were unable to make use of the instructions.\n\nIncreasing density also led to rapid growth in memory sizes, to the\npoint that researchers began to question the need for variable-length\ninstructions.  Recall that variable-length instructions allow shorter\ncodes by providing more efficient instruction encodings.  With the\ntrend toward larger memories, code length was less important.  The\nperformance advantage of fixed-length instructions, which simplifies\nthe datapath and enables pipelining, on the other hand, was \nattractive.\n\nResearchers leveraged these ideas, which had been floating around the\nresearch community (and had appeared in some commercial architectures)\nto create { reduced instruction set computers}, or { RISC}\nmachines.  The competing VAXen were labeled { CISC} machines, which\nstands for { complex instruction set computers}.\n\nRISC machines employ fixed-length instructions and a load-store\narchitecture, allowing only a few addressing modes and small offsets.\nThis combination of design decisions enables deep pipelines and\nmultiple instruction issues in a single cycle (termed superscalar\nimplementations), and for years, RISC machines were viewed by many\nresearchers as the proper design for future ISAs.  However, companies\nsuch as Intel soon learned to pipeline microoperations after decoding\ninstructions, and CISC architectures now offer competitive if not\nsuperior performance in comparison with RISC machines.  The VAXen are\ndead, of course,{Unless you talk with customer support\nemployees, for whom no machine ever dies.}  having been replaced by\nthe Alpha, which in turn fell to x86, which is now struggling with ARM\nto enter the mobile market.  \n\n\n",
