       "['2.1 Optimizing Logic Expressions 35 variables as an operation for this metric because the complements o f variables are sometimes available at no extra cost in gates or wires. If we add the number of operations in our example, we get a count of 10 for Equation (3)—two ANDs, two ORs, and 6 variables, a count of 12 for Equation (4)—three ANDS, one OR, and 8 variables, and a count of 31 for Equation (5)—six ANDs, on e OR, and 24 variables. The relative diﬀerences between these equations are reduced when one count s operations. A second metric of interest is a heuristic for the performance of a d esign. Performance is inversely related to the delay necessary for a design to produce an output once its in puts are available. For example, if you know how many seconds it takes to produce a result, you can easily c alculate the number of results that can be produced per second, which measures performance. The m easurement needed is the longest chain of operations performed on any instance of a variable. The complemen t of a variable is included if the variable’s complement is not available without using an inverter. The rationale fo r this metric is that gate outputs do not change instantaneously when their inputs change. Once an inpu t to a gate has reached an appropriate voltage to represent a 0 or a 1, the transistors in the gate switch ( on or oﬀ) and electrons start to move. Only when the output of the gate reaches the appropriate new volt age can the gates driven by the output start to change. If we count each function/gate as one delay (we call this time a gate delay ), we get an estimate of the time needed to compute the function. Referring ag ain to our example equations, we ﬁnd that Equation (3) requires 3 gate delays, Equation (4) requires 2 g ate delays, Equation (5) requires 2 or 3 gate delays, depending on whether we have variable complements av ailable. Now Equation (4) looks more attractive: better performance than Equation (3) in return for a small extra cost in area. Heuristics for estimating energy use are too complex to introduce a t this point, but you should be aware that every time electrons move, they generate heat, so we might favor an expression that minimizes the number of bit transitions inside the computation. Such a measurement is not easy to calculate by hand, since you need to know the likelihood of input combinations. 2.1.2 Terminology We use many technical terms when we talk about simpliﬁcation of logic e xpressions, so we now introduce those terms so as to make the description of the tools and process es easier to understand. Let’s assume that we have a logic function F(A,B,C,D ) that we want to express concisely. A literalin an expression of Frefers to either one of the variables or its complement. In other wo rds, for our function F, the following is a complete set of literals: A,A,B,B,C,C,D, andD. When we introduced the AND and OR functions, we also introduced no tation borrowed from arithmetic, usingmultiplicationto representANDandadditiontorepresentOR. W ealsoborrowthe relatedterminology, so asumin Boolean algebra refers to a number of terms OR’d together (for e xample,A+B, orAB+CD), and aproduct in Boolean algebra refers to a number of terms AND’d together (for example, AD, or AB(C+D). Note that the terms in a sum or product may themselves be sums, products, or other types of expressions (for example, A⊕B). The construction method that we used to demonstrate logical com pleteness made use of minterms for each input combination for which the function Fproduces a 1. We can now use the idea of a literal to give a simpler deﬁnition of minterm: a minterm for a function on Nvariables is a product (AND function) ofNliterals in which each variable or its complement appears exactly once. For our function F, examples of minterms include ABCD,ABCD, andABCD. As you know, a minterm produces a 1 for exactly one combination of inputs. When we sum minterms for each output value of 1 in a truth table to ex press a function, as we did to obtain Equation(5), weproduceanexampleofthesum-of-productsfor m. Inparticular,a sum-of-products (SOP) is a sum composed of products of literals. Terms in a sum-of-produc ts need not be minterms, however. Equation (4) is also in sum-of-products form. Equation (3), howev er, is not, since the last term in the sum is not a product of literals. Analogously to the idea of a minterm, we deﬁne a maxterm for a function on Nvariables as a sum (OR function) of Nliterals in which each variable or its complement appears exactly once. Examples for F',\n",

Just as we did with minterms, we can multiply a ma xterm corresponding to each input combination for which a function produces 0 (each row in a trut h table that produces a 0 output) to create an expression for the function. The resulting expressio n is in a product-of-sums (POS) form: a product of sums of literals. The carry out function that we used t o produce Equation (5) has 10 input combinations that produce 0, so the expression formed in this way is unpleasantly long: C= (A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0) (A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0) (A1+A0+B1+B0)(A1+A0+B1+B0) However, the approach can be helpful with functions that produc e mostly 1s. The literals in maxterms are complemented with respect to the literals used in minterms. For exam ple, the maxterm ( A1+A0+B1+B0) in the equation above produces a zero for input combination A1= 1,A0= 1,B1= 0,B0= 0. Animplicant Gof a function Fis deﬁned to be a second function operating on the same variables fo r which the implication G→Fis true. In terms of logic functions that produce 0s and 1s, ifGis an implicant of F, the input combinations for which Gproduces 1s are a subset of the input combinations for which Fproduces 1s. Any minterm for which Fproduces a 1, for example, is an implicant of F. In the context of logic design, the term implicant is used to refer to a single product of lite rals.In other words, if we have a function F(A,B,C,D ), examples of possible implicants of FincludeAB,BC,ABCD, andA. In contrast, although they may technically imply F, we typically do not call expressions such as (A+B),C(A+D), norAB+Cimplicants. Let’s say that we have expressed function Fin sum-of-products form. All of the individual product terms in the expression are implicants of F. As a ﬁrst step in simpliﬁcation, we can ask: for each implicant, is it possible to remove any of the literals that make up the product? If w e have an implicant Gfor which the answer is no, we call Gaprime implicant ofF. In other words, if one removes any of the literals from a prime implicant GofF, the resulting product is not an implicant of F. Prime implicants are the main idea that we use to simplify logic expression s, both algebraically and with graphical tools (computer tools use algebra internally—by graphica l here we mean drawings on paper). 2.1.3 Veitch Charts and Karnaugh Maps Veitch’s 1952 paper was the ﬁrst to introduce the idea of using a gra phical representation to simplify logic expressions. Earlier approaches were algebraic. A year later, Mau rice Karnaugh published a paper showing a similar idea with a twist. The twist makes the use of Karnaugh maps to simplify expressions much easier than the use of Veitch charts. As a result, few engineers have hea rd of Veitch, but everyone who has ever taken a class on digital logic knows how to make use of a K-map. Before we introduce the Karnaugh map, let’s think about the structure of the domain of a logic function. Recall that a function’s domain is the space on which the function is deﬁned, that is, for which the function produces values. For a Boolean logic function on Nvariables, you can think of the domain as sequences ofNbits, but you can also visualize the domain as an N-dimensional hypercube. AnA A A=1 A=0A BBA AB=01AB=00 AB=10 AB=11A A BBC C ABC=001 ABC=101 ABC=111 ABC=011ABC=000 ABC=100 ABC=110 ABC=010 N-dimensional hypercube is the generalization of a cube to Ndimensions. Some people only use the term hypercube when N≥4, since we have other names for the smaller values: a point for N= 0, a line segment for N= 1, a square for N= 2, and a cube for N= 3. The diagramsabove and to the right illustrate the cases that are easily drawn on paper. The black dots represen t speciﬁc input combinations, and the blue edges connect input combinations that diﬀer in exactly one input valu e (one bit).',\n",
       " '2.1 Optimizing Logic Expressions 37 By viewing a function’s domain in this way, we can make a connection bet ween a product of literals and the structure of the domain. Let’s use the 3-dimensional version a s an example. We call the variables A,B, andC, and note that the cube has 23= 8 corners corresponding to the 23possible combinations of A,B, andC. The simplest product of literals in this case is 1, which is the product o f 0 literals. Obviously, the product 1 evaluates to 1 for any variable values. We can thus think o f it as covering the entire domain of the function. In the case of our example, the product 1 covers th e whole cube. In order for the product 1 to be an implicant of a function, the function itself must be the function 1. What about a product consisting of a single literal, such as AorC? The dividing lines in the diagram illustrate the answer: any such product term evaluates to 1 on a fa ce of the cube, which includes 22= 4 of the corners. If a function evaluates to 1 on any of the six faces of the cube, the corresponding product term (consisting of a single literal) is an implicant of the function. Continuing with products of two literals, we see that any product of two literals, such as ABorBC, corresponds to an edge of our 3-dimensional cube. The edge includ es 21= 2 corners. And, if a function evaluates to 1 on any of the 12 edges of the cube, the correspond ing product term (consisting of two literals) is an implicant of the function. Finally, any product of three literals, such as ABC, corresponds to a corner of the cube. But for a function on three variables, these are just the minterms. As you know, if a f unction evaluates to 1 on any of the 8 corners of the cube, that minterm is an implicant of the function (we used this idea to construct the function to prove logical completeness). How do these connections help us to simplify functions? If we’re care ful, we can map cubes onto paper in such a way that product terms (the possible implicants of the funct ion) usually form contiguous groups of 1s, allowing us to spot them easily. Let’s work upwards starting from one variable to see how this idea works. The end result is called a Karnaugh map. The ﬁrst drawing shown to the right replicates our view of the 1-dimensional hypercube, corresponding to the domain of a fu nc- tion on one variable, in this case the variable A. To the right of the hypercube (line segment) are two variants of a Karnaugh map on on e variable. The middle variant clearly indicates the column correspond- ing to the product A(the other column corresponds to A). The right variant simply labels the column with values for A.010 1A 010 1A A A A=1 A=0 The three drawings shown to the right illustrate the three possible product terms on one variable. The functions shown in these Karnaugh maps are arbitrary, except that we have chosen them such that each implicant shown is a prime implicant for the illustrated fun ction.10 1A 010 1A 10 1A 10 implicant: 1 implicant: A implicant: A Let’s now look at two-variable functions. We have repli- catedourdrawingofthe 2-dimensionalhypercube (square) to the right along with two variants of Karnaugh maps on two variables. With only two variables ( AandB), the extension is fairly straightforward, since we can use the second dimension of the paper (vertical) to express the second variable ( B).A BB0 11 00 10 1 BA A AB=01AB=00 AB=10 AB=11A 0 11 0 10 1 B0',\n",

For two variables, nine are possible, as shown to the right. Notice that all implicants have two properties. First, they oc- cupy contiguous regions of the grid. And, second, their height and width are always powers of two. These properties seem somewhat trivial at this stage, but they are the key to the utility of K-maps on more vari- ables.A 11 0 10 1 B1 1 A 0 10 1 BA 00 10 1 B10A 0 10 1 BA 0 10 10 1 B0A 10 10 1 BA 0 11 0 10 1 B1A 10 10 1 BA 0 11 0 10 1 B0 110 11 0 0 1 0 0 0 11 0 0 0implicant: 1 implicant: AB implicant: AB implicant: AB implicant: ABimplicant: B implicant: B implicant: A implicant: A Three-variable functions are next. The cube diagram is again replicated to the right. But now we have a problem: how can we map four points (say, from the top half of the cube) into a line in such a way that any points connected by a blue line are adjacent in the K-map? The answer is that we cannot, but we can preserve most of the connections by choosing an order such as the one illustrated by the arrow. The result00 01 11 10 0 11 01 1 1 1AC 0 1B00 01 11 10 0 11 01 1 1 10 1AA A BBC C B CABC=001 ABC=101 ABC=111 ABC=011ABC=000 ABC=100 ABC=110 ABC=010 is called a Gray code. Two K-map variants again appear to the right of the cube. Look closely at the order of the two-variable combinations along the top, which allows us to hav e as many contiguous products of literals as possible. Any product of literals that contains Cbut notAnorAwraps around the edges of the K-map, so you should think of it as rolling up into a cylinder rather than a grid. Or you can think that we’re unfolding the cube to ﬁt the corners onto a sheet of paper, b ut the place that we split the cube should still be considered to be adjacent when looking for implicants. The us e of a Gray code is the one diﬀerence between a K-map and a Veitch chart; Veitch used the base 2 order, which makes some implicants hard to spot. With three variables, we have 27 possible products of literals. You ma y have noticed that the count scales as 3NforNvariables; can you explain why? We illustrate several product terms below. Note that we sometimes need to wrap around the end of the K-map, but that if we account for wrapping, the squares covered by all product terms are contiguous. Also notice that bot h the width and the height of all product terms are powers of two. Any square or rectangle that meets these two constraints cor responds to a prod- uct term! And any such squareor rectangle that is ﬁlled with 1s is an implicant of t he function in the K-map.

With a function on four variables— A,B,C, andD—we can use a Gray code order on two ofthevariablesin eachdimension. Whichvariablesgowith whichdimensio ninthe gridreallydoesn’tmatter, so we’ll assign ABto the horizontal dimension and CDto the vertical dimension. A few of the 81 possible product terms are illustrated at the top of the next page. Notice t hat while wrapping can now occur in both dimensions, we have exactly the same rule for ﬁnding implicants of the function: any square or rectangle (al- lowing for wrapping) that is ﬁlled with 1s and has both height and width e qual to (possibly diﬀerent) powers of two is an implicant of the function. Furthermore, unless such a square or rectangle is part of a la rger square or rectangle that meets these criteria, the correspo nding implicant is a prime implicant of the function.',\n",

The metric that you choose to minimize the set may var y in practice, but for simplicity, let’s say that we minimize the number of prime implicants chosen. Let’s try a few!

Ce rtainly Gray codes can be extended. An N-bit Gray code is a sequence of N-bit patterns that includes all possible patterns such that any two adjacent patterns diﬀer in only one bit. The code is actually a cycle: t he ﬁrst and last patterns also diﬀer in only one bit. You can construct a Gray code recursively as follows: for an (N+1)-bit Gray code, write the sequence for an N-bit Gray code, then add a 0 in front of all patterns. After this seq uence, append a second copy of the N-bit Gray code in reverse order, then put a 1 in front of all pattern s in the second copy. The result is an ( N+1)-bit Gray code. For example, the following are Gray codes: 1-bit 0, 1 2-bit 00, 01, 11, 10 3-bit 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100 4-bit 0000, 0001, 0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 11 01, 1111, 1110, 1010, 1011, 1001, 1000 Unfortunately, some of the beneﬁcial properties of K-maps do no t extend beyond two variables in a di- mension. Once you have three variables in one dimension , as is necessary if a function operates on ﬁve or more variables, not all product terms are contiguous in the grid . The terms still require a total number of rows and columns equal to a power of two, but they don’t all need to be a contiguous group. Furthermore, some contiguous groups of appropriate size do not correspon d to product terms . So you can still make use of K-maps if you have more variables, but their use is a little trickier.',\n",

Such a comparison is a test of logical equivalence , and is an important part of hardware design. Tools today provide help with this problem, but you should understand the problem. You know that any given function can be expressed in many ways, an d that two expressions that look quite diﬀerent may in fact represent the same function (look back at Equ ations (3) to (5) for an example). But what if we rewrite the function using only prime implicants? Is the resu lt unique? Unfortunately, no. In general, a sum of products is not unique (nor is a product of sums), even if the sum contains only prime implicants . For example, consensus terms may or may not be included in our expr essions. (They are necessary for reliable design of certain types of systems, as y ou will learn in a later ECE class.) The green ellipse in the K-map to the right represent s the consensus termBC. Z=A C+A B+B C Z=A C+A B00 01 11 10 0 1Z BC A 1 1 0 001 0 1 Some functions allow several equivalent formulations as sums of prime implicants, even without consensus terms. The K-maps shown to the right, for example, illustrate how one function might be written in either of the following ways: Z=AB D+A CD+A B C+BC D Z=AB C+B CD+A B D+AC D000 01 11 10 00 1 01 1100 01 11 10CD AB1 1 1 0 000 1Z 000 01 11 10 00 1 01 1100 01 11 10CD AB1 1 1 0 000 1Z When we need to compare two things (such as functions), we need t o transform them into what in math- ematics is known as a canonical form , which simply means a form that is deﬁned so as to be unique for each thing of the given type. What can we use for logic functions? Yo u already know two answers! The canonical sum of a function (sometimes called the canonical SOP form ) is the sum of minterms. The canonical product of a function (sometimes called the canonical POS form ) is the product of maxterms. These forms technically only meet the mathematical deﬁnition of can onical if we agree on an order for the min/maxterms, but that problem is solvable. However, as you alread y know, the forms are not particularly convenient to use. In practice, people and tools in the industry use more compact approaches when compar- ing functions, but those solutions are a subject for a later class (s uch as ECE 462). 2.1.5 Two-Level Logic Two-level logic is a popular way of expressing logic functions. The two levels refer simply to the number offunctions through which an input passes to r each an output, and boththeSOPandPOSformsareexamplesoftwo-levellogic. Inthiss ection, weillustrate one of the reasons for this popularity and show you how to graphica lly manipulate expressions, which can sometimes help when trying to understand g ate diagrams. We begin with one of DeMorgan’s laws, which we can illustrate both algeb raically and graphically: C=B+A=BAA BCA BC',\n",
       " '2.1 Optimizing Logic Expressions 41 Let’s say that we have a function expressed in SOP form, such as Z=ABC+DE+FGHJ. The diagram on the left below shows the function constructed from three AND g ates and an OR gate. Using DeMorgan’s law, we can replace the OR gate with a NAND with inverted inputs. But t he bubbles that correspond to inversion do not need to sit at the input to the gate. We can invert at any point along the wire, so we slide each bubble down the wire to the output of the ﬁrst column of AND ga tes.Be careful: if the wire splits, which does not happen in our example, you have to replicate th e inverter onto the other output paths as you slide past the split point! The end result is shown on the right: we have not changed the funct ion, but now we use only NAND gates. Since CMOS technology only supports NAND a nd NOR directly, using two-level logic makes it simple to map our expression into CMOS gates.

Becoming a good engineer thus requires not only that you b e able to solve problems creatively so as to improve the quality of your solutions, but also that you are awa re of how people might evaluate those solutions and are able both to identify the most important metrics an d to balance your design eﬀectively according to them. In this section, we introduce some general idea s and methods that may be of use to you in this regard. We will not test you on the concepts in this section. When you start thinking about a new problem, your ﬁrst step should be to think carefully about metrics of possible interest. Some important metrics may not be easy to qua ntify. For example, compatibility of a design with other products already owned by a customer has freq uently deﬁned the success or failure of computer hardware and software solutions. But how can you comp ute the compability of your approach as a number? Humans—including engineers—are not good at comparing multiple metr ics simultaneously. Thus, once you have a set of metrics that you feel is complete, your next step is to get rid of as many as you can. Towards this end, you may identify metrics that have no practical impact in cu rrent technology, set threshold values for other metrics to simplify reasoning about them, eliminate redund ant metrics, calculate linear sums to reduce the count of metrics, and, ﬁnally, make use of the notion of Pareto optimality. All of these ideas are described in the rest of this section. Let’s start by considering metrics that we can quantify as real num bers. For a given metric, we can divide possible measurement values into three ranges. In the ﬁrst range , all measurement values are equivalently useful. In the second range, possible values are ordered and inter esting with respect to one another. Values in the third range are all impossible to use in practice. Using power con sumption as our example, the ﬁrst rangecorrespondsto systems in which when a processor’spowerc onsumption in a digitalsystem is extremely low relative to the power consumption of the system. For example, t he processor in a computer might use less than 1% of the total used by the system including the disk drive, the monitor, the power supply, and so forth. One power consumption value in this range is just as good as a ny another, and no one cares about the power consumption of the processor in such cases. In the second range, power consumption of the processor',\n",
       " '42 c/⌋ir⌋l⌉⌋opyrt2000-2017 Steven S. Lumetta. All rights reserved. makes a diﬀerence. Cell phones use most of their energy in radio ope ration, for example, but if you own a phone with a powerful processor, you may have noticed that you can turn oﬀ the phone and drain the battery fairly quickly by playing a game. Designing a processor that u ses half as much power lengthens the battery life in such cases. Finally, the third region of power consump tion measurements is impossible: if you use so much power, your chip will overheat or even burst into ﬂames . Consumers get unhappy when such things happen. As a ﬁrst step, you can remove any metrics for which all solutions ar e eﬀectively equivalent. Until a little less than a decade ago, for example, the power consumption of a de sktop processor actually was in the ﬁrst range that we discussed. Power was simply not a concern to enginee rs: all designs of interest consumed so little power that no one cared. Unfortunately, at that point, powe r consumption jumped into the third range rather quickly. Processors hit a wall, and products had to be cance lled. Given that the time spent designing a processor has historically been about ﬁve years, a lot of engineer ing eﬀort was wasted because people had not thought carefully enough about power (since it had never matt ered in the past). Today, power is an important metric that engineers must take into account in their des igns. However, in some areas, such as desktop and high-end server pro cessors, other metrics (such as performance) may be so important that we always want to operate at the edge of t he interesting range. In such cases, we might choose to treat a metric such as power consumption as a threshold : stay below 150 Watts for a desktop processor, for example. One still has to make a coordinat ed eﬀort to ensure that the system as a whole does not exceed the threshold, but reasoning about thresh old values, a form of constraint, is easier than trying to think about multiple metrics at once. Some metrics may only allow discrete quantiﬁcation. For example, one could choose to deﬁne compatibility with previous processor generations as binary: either an existing p iece of software (or operating system) runs out of the box on your new processor, or it does not. If you want p eople who own that software to make use of your new processor, you must ensure that the value of this bina ry metric is 1, which can also be viewed as a threshold. In some cases, two metrics may be strongly correlated , meaning that a design that is good for one of the metrics is frequently good for the other metric as well. Chip area and cost, for example, are technically distinct ways to measure a digital design, but we rarely consider the m separately. A design that requires a larger chip is probably more complex, and thus takes more engineerin g time to get right (engineering time costs money). Each silicon wafer costs money to fabricate, and fe wer copies of a large design ﬁt on one wafer, so large chips mean more fabrication cost. Physical defect s in silicon can cause some chips not to work. A large chip uses more silicon than a small one, and is thus more lik ely to suﬀer from defects (and not work). Cost thus goes up again for large chips relative to small o nes. Finally, large chips usually require more careful testing to ensure that they work properly (even ign oring the cost of getting the design right, we have to test for the presence of defects), which adds still mor e cost for a larger chip. All of these factors tend to correlate chip area and chip cost, to the point that most en gineers do not consider both metrics. After youhavetriedto reduceyourset ofmetricsasmuchasposs ible, orsimpliﬁed thembyturningthem into thresholds, youshould considerturningthelastfew metricsintoaw eightedlinearsum. All remainingmetrics must be quantiﬁable in this case. For example, if you are left with thre e metrics for which a given design has valuesA,B, andC, you might reduce these to one metric by calculating D=wAA+wBB+wCC. What are thewvalues? They are weights for the three metrics. Their values repre sent the relative importance of the three metrics to the overall evaluation. Here we’ve assumed th at larger values of A,B, andCare either all good or all bad. If you have metrics with diﬀerent senses, use th e reciprocal values. For example, if a large value of Ais good, a small value of 1 /Ais also good. The diﬃculty with linearizing metrics is that not everyone agrees on th e weights. Is using less power more important than having a cheaper chip? The answer may depend on ma ny factors. When you are left with several metrics of interest, you can use the idea of Pareto optimality to identify interesting designs. Let’s say that you have two metrics. If a desig nD1is better than a second design D2 for both metrics, we say that D1dominates D2. A design Dis then said to be Pareto optimal if no other design dominates D. Consider the ﬁgure on the left below, which illustrates seven possib le designs measured',\n",
       " '2.1 Optimizing Logic Expressions 43 with two metrics. The design corresponding to point Bdominates the designs corresponding to points A andC, so neither of the latter designs is Pareto optimal. No other point in t he ﬁgure dominates B, however, so that design is Pareto optimal. If we remove all points that do not r epresent Pareto optimal designs, and instead include only those designs that are Pareto optimal, we obtain the version shown on the right. These are points in a two-dimensional space, not a line, but we can imagine a lin e going through the points, as illustrated in the ﬁgure: the points that make up the line are called a Pareto curve , or, if you have more than two metrics, a Pareto surface . dominated by point B good badbadgood metric 1metric 2AB E D FGC good badbadgood metric 1metric 2B E FG AsanexampleoftheuseofParetooptimality, consider the ﬁgure to the right, which is copied with permission from Neal Crago’s Ph.D. dissertation (UIUC ECE, 2012). The ﬁgure compares hundreds of thousands of possible designs based on a handful of diﬀerent core approaches for implementing a processor. The axes in the graph are two metrics of interest. The horizontal axis measures the average performance of a design when executing a set of benchmark applications, nor- malized to a baseline processor design. The vertical axis measures the energy consumed by a design when executing the same benchmarks, normalized again to the energy co nsumed by a baseline design. The six sets of points in the graph represent alternative design technique s for the processor, most of which are in commercial use today. The points shown for each set are the subs et of many thousands of possible variants that are Paretooptimal. In this case, moreperformanceand less e nergyconsumption arethe good directions, so any point in a set for which another point is both further to the rig ht and further down is not shown in the graph. The black line represents an absolute power consumption of 150 Watts, which is a nominal threshold for a desktop environment. Designs above and to the right of that line are not as interesting for desktop use. Thedesign-space exploration that Neal reported in this ﬁgure was of course done by many compu ters using many hours of computation, but he had to design the process by which the computers calculated each of the points.',\n",

ECE120: Introduction to Computer Engineering Notes Set 2.2 Boolean Properties and Don’t Care Simpliﬁcati on This set of notes begins with a brief illustration of a few properties of Boolean logic, which may be of use to you in manipulating algebraic expressions and in identifying equivalen t logic functions without resorting to truth tables. We then discuss the value of underspecifying a logic function so as to allow for selection of the simplest possible implementation. This technique must be used car efully to avoid incorrect behavior, so we illustrate the possibility of misuse with an example, then talk about s everal ways of solving the example correctly. We conclude by generalizing the ideas in the example to sev eral important application areas and talking about related problems. 2.2.1 Logic Properties Table 2 (on the next page) lists a number of properties of Boolean log ic. Most of these are easy to derive from our earlier deﬁnitions, but a few may be surprising to you. In pa rticular, in the algebra of real numbers, multiplication distributes over addition, but addition does not distribu te over multiplication. For example, 3×(4+7) = (3×4) + (3×7), but 3 + (4×7)/n⌉}ationslash= (3 + 4)×(3+7). In Boolean algebra, both operators distribute over one another, as indicated in Table 2. The consensus properties may also be nonintuitive. Drawing a K-map may help you understand the consensus property on the right side of the table. For the consensus variant on the left side of the table, consider that since eitherAorAmust be 0, either BorC or both must be 1 for the ﬁrst two factors on the left to be 1 when A NDed together. But in that case, the third factor is also 1, and is thus redundant. As mentioned previously, Boolean algebra has an elegant symmetry k nown as a duality, in which any logic statement (an expression or an equation) is related to a second log ic statement. To calculate the dual formof a Boolean expression or equation, replace 0 with 1, replace 1 with 0 , replace AND with OR, and replaceOR with AND. Variables are not changed when ﬁnding the dual form. The dual form ofa dual form is the original logic statement. Be careful when calculating a dual for m: our convention for ordering arithmetic operations is broken by the exchange, so you may want to add explic it parentheses before calculating the dual. For example, the dual of AB+Cis notA+BC. Rather, the dual of AB+Cis (A+B)C.Add parentheses as necessary when calculating a dual form to ens ure that the order of operations does not change. Duality has several useful practical applications. First, the principle of duality states that any theorem or identity has the same truth value in dual form (we do not prove th e principle here). The rows of Table 2 are organized according to this principle: each row contains two equ ations that are the duals of one another. Second, the dual form is useful when designing certain types of log ic, such as the networks of transistors connecting the output of a CMOS gate to high voltage and ground. I f you look at the gate designs in the textbook (and particularly those in the exercises), you will notice t hat these networks are duals. A func- tion/expression is not a theorem nor an identity, thus the principle o f duality does not apply to the dual of an expression. However, if you treat the value 0 as “true,” the d ual form of an expression has the same truth values as the original (operating with value 1 as “true”). Fina lly, you can calculate the complement of a Boolean function (any expression) by calculating the dual form and then complementing each variable. 2.2.2 Choosing the Best Function When we specify how something works using a human language, we leav e out details. Sometimes we do so deliberately, assuming that a reader or listener can provide the det ails themselves: “Take me to the airport!” rather than “Please bend your right arm at the elbow and shift your right upper arm forward so as to place your hand near the ignition key. Next, ...” YouknowthebasictechniqueforimplementingaBooleanfunctionusin gcombinational logic : useaK-map to identify a reasonable SOP or POS form, draw the resulting design, and perhaps convert to NAND/NOR gates.']"
