      "page_content='82  3.1.3 Finite State Machines Aﬁnite state machine (orFSM) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describin g the system as occupying one of a ﬁnite set of states, moving betwe en these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs. In any given state, a pa rticular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this combination is called a transition rule . An FSM comprises ﬁve parts: a ﬁnite set of states, a set of possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules, and methods for calculating outputs. When an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be rep resented as patterns using a ﬁxed number of bits, all inputs must be translated into bits, and all outpu ts must be translated into bits. For a digital FSM, transition rules must be complete ; in other words, given any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits, a transition must be deﬁned from that state to another state (transitions from a state to itself, called self-loops , are acceptable). And, of course, calculation of outputs for a dig ital FSM reduces to Boolean logic expressions. In this class, we focus on clocked sync hronous FSM implementations, in which the FSM’s internal state bits are stored in ﬂip-ﬂops. In this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, a nd analyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic. In the next few weeks, we will show you how an FSM can se rve as the central control logic in a computer. At the same time, we will illustrate connections between F SMs and software and will make some connections with other areas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital control systems. The table below gives a list of abstract states for a typical keyless entry system for a car. In this case, we have merely named the states rather than specifying the bit pat terns to be used for each state—for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states. The description of the states in the ﬁrst column is an optional element often included in the early design stages for an FSM, when ide ntifying the states needed for the design. A list may also include the outputs for each state. Again, in th e list below, we have speciﬁed these outputs abstractly. By including outputs for each state, we implicit ly assume that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM. We discuss this assumption in more detail later in these notes (see “Machine Models”), but will make the assumption throughout our class. meaning state driver’s door other doors alarm on vehicle locked LOCKED locked locked no driver door unlocked DRIVER unlocked locked no all doors unlocked UNLOCKED unlocked unlocked no alarm sounding ALARM locked locked yes Another tool used with FSMs is the next-state table (sometimes called a state transition table , or just astate table ), which maps the current state and input combination into the next state of the FSM. The abstract variant shown below outlines desired behavior at a high leve l, and is often ambiguous, incomplete, and even inconsistent. For example, what happens if a user pushes two buttons? What happens if they push unlock while the alarm is sounding? These questions should event ually be considered. However, we can already start to see the intended use of the design: starting f rom a locked car, a user can push “unlock” once to gain entry to the driver’s seat, or push “unlock” twice to op en the car fully for passengers. To lock the car, a user can push the “lock” button at any time. And, if a use r needs help, pressing the “panic” button sets oﬀ an alarm. state action/input next state LOCKED push “unlock” DRIVER DRIVER push “unlock” UNLOCKED (any) push “lock” LOCKED (any) push “panic” ALARM' lookup_str='' metadata={'page_number': 87.0, 'textbook_name': 'ECE-120-student-notes'} lookup_index=0\n",

After discussing a simple application of stored state to trade between area and performance, we introduce a powerful abstraction for formalizin g and reasoning about digital systems, the Finite State Machine (FSM). General FSM models are broadly applicab le in a range of engineering contexts, including not only hardware and software design but also the design o f control systems and distributed systems. We limit our model so as to avoid circuit timing issues in your ﬁr st exposure, but provide some amount of discussion as to how, when, and why you should eventually learn the more sophisticated models. Through development a range of FSM examples, we illustrate importa nt design issues for these systems and motivateacoupleofmoreadvancedcombinationallogicdevicesthat canbe usedasbuilding blocks. Together with the idea of memory, another form of stored state, these elem ents form the basis for development of our ﬁrst computer. At this point we return to the textbook, in whic h Chapters 4 and 5 provide a solid introduction to the von Neumann model of computing systems and t he LC-3 (Little Computer, version 3) instruction set architecture. By the end of this part of the cours e, you will have seen an example of the boundary between hardware and software, and will be ready to wr ite some instructions yourself. In this set of notes, we cover the ﬁrst few parts of this material. W e begin by describing the conversion of bit-sliced designs into serial designs, which store a single bit slice’s out put in ﬂip-ﬂops and then feed the outputs back into the bit slice in the next cycle. As a speciﬁc example, we use our bit-sliced comparator to discuss tradeoﬀs in area and performance. We introduce Finite S tate Machines and some of the tools used to design them, then develop a handful of simple counter desig ns. Before delving too deeply into FSM design issues, we spend a little time discussing other strategies for c ounter design and placing the material covered in our course in the broader context of digital system des ign. Remember that sections marked with an asterisk are provided solely for your interest, but you may need to learn this material in later classes. 3.1.1 Serialization: General Strategy In previous notes, we discussed and illustrated the development of bit-sliced logic, in which one designs a logic block to handle one bit of a multi-bit operation, then replicates th e bit slice logic to construct a design for the entire operation. We developed ripple carry adders in this wa y in Notes Set 2.3 and both unsigned and 2’s complement comparators in Notes Set 2.4. Another interesting design strategy is serialization : rather than replicating the bit slice, we can use ﬂip- ﬂops to store the bits passed from one bit slice to the next, then pr esent the stored bits to the same bit slice in the next cycle. Thus, in a serial design, we only need one copy of th e bit slice logic! The area needed for a serial design is usually much less than for a bit-sliced design, but such a design is also usually slower. After illustrating the general design strategy, we’ll consider thes e tradeoﬀs more carefully in the context of a detailed example. Recall the general bit-sliced design ap- proach, as illustrated to the right. Some number of copies of the logic for a single bit slice are connected in sequence. Each bit slice accepts Pbits of operand input and produces Qbits of external output. Adjacent bit slices receive an addi- tionalMbits of information from the previous bit slice and pass along Mbits to the next bit slice, generallyusing some representation chosen by the designer.P Qsecond bit sliceMP Qlast bit sliceMP QM Moutput logicRinitial values . . .first bit sliceresults per−slice outputsper−slice inputsa general bit−sliced design The ﬁrst bit slice is initialized by passing in constant values, and some ca lculation may be performed on the ﬁnal bit slice’s results to produce Rbits more external output.' lookup_str='' metadata={'page_number': 84.0, 'textbook_name': 'ECE-120-student-notes'} lookup_index=0\n",

We might then try to leverage the fact that the next- state patterns from these two states are not relevant (recall that we ﬁxed the next-state patterns for all four of the possible PAID states) to further simplify our logic, but doing so does not provide any advan- tage (you may want to check our claim).

A state transition diagram appears at the bottom of this page. 3.3.4 Testing the Design Having a complete design on paper is a good step forward, but human s make mistakes at all stages. How can we know that a circuit that we build in the lab correctly implements t he FSM that we have outlined in these notes? For the lab design, we have two problems to solve. First, we have not speciﬁed an initialization scheme for the FSM. We may want the FSM to start in one of the PAID states, bu t adding initialization logic to the design may mean requiring you to wire together signiﬁcantly more chip s. Second, we need a sequence of inputs that manages to test that all of the next-state and outpu t logic implementations are correct. Testing sequential logic, including FSMs, is in general extremely diﬃcu lt. In fact, large sequential systems today are generally converted into combinational logic by using shift registers to ﬁll the ﬂip-ﬂops with a particular pattern, executing the logic for one clock cycle, and che cking that the resulting pattern of bits in the ﬂip-ﬂops is correct. This approach is called scan-based testing , and is discussed in ECE 543. You will make use of a similar approach when you test your combinational logic in the second week of the lab, before wiring up the ﬂip-ﬂops. We have designed our FSM to be easy to test (even small FSMs may be challenging) with a brute force approach. In particular, we identify two input sequences that tog ether serve both to initialize and to test a correctly implemented variant of our FSM. Our initialization sequence forces the FSM into a speciﬁc state regardless of its initial state. And our test sequence crosses eve ry transition arc leaving the six valid states. In terms of T, the coin type, we initialize the FSM with the input sequence 001. Notic e that such a sequence takes any initial state into PAID2. For testing, we use the input sequence 111010010001. You should trace this sequence, starting from PAID2, on the diagram below to see how the test sequence covers all of the possible arcs. As we test, we need also to observe the AandPoutputs in each state to check the output logic.

      "3.6 Sequential Logic Circuits 79 Combinational logic ci rcuit Sto rage elementsOutput Input Figure 3.22 Sequential logic circuit block diagram. In this section, we discuss digital logic structures that can both process infor- mation (i.e., make decisions) andstore information. That is, these structures base their decisions not only on the input values now present, but also (and this is very important) on what has happened before. These structures are usually called sequential logic circuits . They are distinguishable from combinational logic cir- cuits because, unlike combinational logic circuits, they contain storage elements that allow them to keep track of prior history information. Figure 3.22 shows a block diagram of a sequential logic circuit. Note the storage elements. Note also that the output can be dependent on both the inputs now and the values stored in the storage elements. The values stored in the storage elements reﬂect the history of what has happened before. Sequential logic circuits are used to implement a very important class of mechanisms called ﬁnite state machines . We use ﬁnite state machines in essen- tially all branches of engineering. For example, they are used as controllers of electrical systems, mechanical systems, and aeronautical systems. A traﬃc light controller that sets the traﬃc light to red, yellow, or green depends on the light that is currently on (history information) and input information from sensors such as trip wires on the road, a timer keeping track of how long the current light has been on, and perhaps optical devices that are monitoring traﬃc. We will see in Chapter 4 when we introduce the von Neumann model of a computer that a ﬁnite state machine is at the heart of the computer. It controls the processing of information by the computer. 3.6.1 A Simple Example: The Combination Lock A simple example shows the diﬀerence between combinational logic structures and sequential logic structures. Suppose one wishes to secure a bicycle with a lock, but does not want to carry a key. A common solution is the combination lock. The person memorizes a “combination” and uses it to open the lock. Two common types of locks are shown in Figure 3.23. In Figure 3.23a, the lock consists of a dial, with the numbers from 0 to 30 equally spaced around its circumference. To open the lock, one needs to know the “combination.” One such combination could be: R13-L22-R3. If this were the case, one would open the lock by turning the dial two complete turns to the right (clockwise), and then continuing until the dial points to 13, followed by one\n",
