Next, the transitions between those states need to be determined. This can be done by looking at how the machine needs to behave in each state and what events would cause it to transition to another state. Finally, the outputs of the machine need to be determined.

When one inverter's output is high, the other inverter's output will be low, and vice versa. This makes it possible for SRAM to store one bit of data."

Alternatively, we can use 8,192 bit\nslices of 1,024 cells.  For the second implementation, we need \ntwo {10-to-1024} decoders, or about 2^ gates.

Sensory memory is the type of memory that allows you to see an object and then remember what it looks like. Short-term memory is the type of memory that allows you to remember things for a short period of time, such as a phone number that you just heard. Long-term memory is the type of memory that allows you to remember things for a long period of time, such as your childhood address. \n\nThe process of storing memories in the brain is called encoding. This is when the brain changes information into a form that can be stored. The process of recalling memories from the brain is called retrieval. This is when the brain accesses stored information and brings it back into conscious awareness. \n\nThere are two types of retrieval: recall and recognition. Recall is when you retrieve information from your memory without any cues or prompts. Recognition is when you retrieve information from your memory with cues or prompts, such as seeing a picture of your childhood home and then remembering what it looked like. \n\nEncoding and retrieval are important processes for maintaining our memories over time.\""

In the high impedance state, the output of the buffer is effectively disconnected from the input, and no current flows through the device. This state is also sometimes called the \"third\" or \"floating\" state. \nIn the low state, the output of the buffer is forced to logic low (0), and in the high state, the output of the buffer is forced to logic high (1)."

First, if an experiment is not conducted in a timely manner, the results may be inaccurate or inconclusive. Second, the timing of different steps can affect the reliability of the results. For example, if an experiment is conducted too quickly, there may be errors in the data that are not caught. Third, the timing of different steps can also affect the validity of the results. For example, if an experiment is conducted too slowly, there may be confounding variables that are not controlled for. Finally, the timing of different steps can also affect the interpretation of the results. For example, if an experiment is conducted at night and the data are interpreted during the day, there may be biases that are introduced."
