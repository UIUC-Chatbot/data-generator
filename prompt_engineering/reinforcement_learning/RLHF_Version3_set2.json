Creating such a code from a Hamming code is\ntrivial: add a parity bit covering the entire Hamming code.  The extra\nparity bit increases the Hamming distance to 4.  A Hamming distance of 4\nstill allows only single bit error correction, but avoids the problem\nof Hamming distance 3 codes when two bit errors occur, since patterns\nat Hamming distance 2 from a valid code word cannot be within distance 1\nof another code word, and thus cannot be ``corrected'' to the wrong\nresult.\n\nIn fact, one can add a parity bit to any representation with an odd\nHamming distance to create a new representation with Hamming distance\none greater than the original representation.  To proof this convenient\nfact, begin with a representation with Hamming distance d, where d\nis odd.  If we choose two code words from the representation, and their \nHamming distance is already greater than d, their distance in the \nnew representation will also be greater than d.  Adding a parity\nbit cannot decrease the distance.  On the other hand, if the two code\nwords are exactly distance d apart, they must have opposite parity,\nsince they differ by an odd number of bits.  Thus the new parity bit\nwill be a 0 for one of the code words and a 1 for the other, increasing\nthe Hamming distance to d+1 in the new representation.  Since all\npairs of code words have Hamming distance of at least d+1, the\nnew representation also has Hamming distance d+1.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The bit slice has C^M provided as an input and \nproduces C^{M+1} as an output.\n\nInternally, we use C_ to denote the carry input,\nand C_ to denote the carry output.\n\nSimilarly, the\nbits A_M and B_M from the numbers A and B are\nrepresented internally as A and B, and the bit S_M produced for\nthe sum S is represented internally as S.  The overloading of\nmeaning should not confuse you, since the context (designing the\nlogic block or thinking about the problem as a whole) should always\nbe clear.\n\nThe abstract device for adding three inputs bits and producing\ntwo output bits is called a { full adder}.  You may \nalso encounter the term { half adder}, which adds only two\ninput bits.  To form an {N-bit} adder, we integrate N\ncopies of the full adder---the bit slice that we design next---as \nshown below.  The result is called a { ripple carry adder}\nbecause the carry information moves from the low bits to the high\nbits slowly, like a ripple on the surface of a pond.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/add-integrated.eps,width=5.5in}}\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Logic Properties}\n\nTable  (on the next page)\nlists a number of properties of Boolean logic.\nMost of these are easy to derive from our earlier definitions, but\na few may be surprising to you.  In particular, in the algebra of\nreal numbers, multiplication\ndistributes over addition, but addition does not distribute over\nmultiplication.  For example, 3{(4+7)}=(3)+(3),\nbut 3+(4)=(3+4){(3+7)}.  In Boolean algebra,\nboth operators distribute over one another, as indicated in\nTable .  The consensus properties may also be \nnonintuitive.  Drawing a {K-map} may help you understand the\nconsensus property on the right side of the table.  For the \nconsensus variant on the left side of the table,\nconsider that since either A or  must be 0,\neither B or C or both must be 1 for the first two factors on the left\nto be 1 when ANDed together.  But in that case, the third factor \nis also 1, and is thus redundant.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Boolean\nalgebra has an elegant symmetry known as a duality, in which any\nlogic statement (an expression or an equation) is related to a\nsecond logic statement.\n\nTo calculate the { dual form} of a Boolean expression or equation, \nreplace 0 with 1, replace 1 with 0, \nreplace AND with OR, and\nreplace OR with AND.\n\n{ Variables are not changed when finding the dual form.}\n\nThe dual form of a dual form is the original logic statement.\n\nBe careful when calculating a dual form: our convention for ordering \narithmetic operations is broken by the exchange, so you may want\nto add explicit parentheses before calculating the dual.  For\nexample, the dual of AB+C is not A+BC.\nRather, the dual of AB+C is (A+B)C.\n\n{ Add parentheses as necessary when calculating a dual form to ensure\nthat the order of operations does not change.}\n\nDuality has several useful practical applications.  First, the \n{ principle of duality} states that any theorem or identity has \nthe same truth value in dual form (we do not prove the principle\nhere).\n\nThe rows of Table  are organized according to this\nprinciple: each row contains two equations that are the duals \nof one another.  \n However, we rename variables freely to\n simplify the dual form.  For example, taking the dual of 1+A=1,\n we obtain 0=0.  But we created variable A \n solely for the purpose of expressing the property, so we might\n instead have called the complementary value A.  We rename\n (using the same name!) to obtain 0=0, as shown in the table.\n\nSecond, the dual form is useful when designing certain types of logic,\nsuch as the networks of transistors connecting the output of a CMOS\ngate to high voltage and ground.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Logic Properties}\n\nTable  (on the next page)\nlists a number of properties of Boolean logic.\nMost of these are easy to derive from our earlier definitions, but\na few may be surprising to you.  In particular, in the algebra of\nreal numbers, multiplication\ndistributes over addition, but addition does not distribute over\nmultiplication.  For example, 3{(4+7)}=(3)+(3),\nbut 3+(4)=(3+4){(3+7)}.  In Boolean algebra,\nboth operators distribute over one another, as indicated in\nTable .  The consensus properties may also be \nnonintuitive.  Drawing a {K-map} may help you understand the\nconsensus property on the right side of the table.  For the \nconsensus variant on the left side of the table,\nconsider that since either A or  must be 0,\neither B or C or both must be 1 for the first two factors on the left\nto be 1 when ANDed together.  But in that case, the third factor \nis also 1, and is thus redundant.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Boolean\nalgebra has an elegant symmetry known as a duality, in which any\nlogic statement (an expression or an equation) is related to a\nsecond logic statement.\n\nTo calculate the { dual form} of a Boolean expression or equation, \nreplace 0 with 1, replace 1 with 0, \nreplace AND with OR, and\nreplace OR with AND.\n\n{ Variables are not changed when finding the dual form.}\n\nThe dual form of a dual form is the original logic statement.\n\nBe careful when calculating a dual form: our convention for ordering \narithmetic operations is broken by the exchange, so you may want\nto add explicit parentheses before calculating the dual.  For\nexample, the dual of AB+C is not A+BC.\nRather, the dual of AB+C is (A+B)C.\n\n{ Add parentheses as necessary when calculating a dual form to ensure\nthat the order of operations does not change.}\n\nDuality has several useful practical applications.  First, the \n{ principle of duality} states that any theorem or identity has \nthe same truth value in dual form (we do not prove the principle\nhere).\n\nThe rows of Table  are organized according to this\nprinciple: each row contains two equations that are the duals \nof one another.  \n However, we rename variables freely to\n simplify the dual form.  For example, taking the dual of 1+A=1,\n we obtain 0=0.  But we created variable A \n solely for the purpose of expressing the property, so we might\n instead have called the complementary value A.  We rename\n (using the same name!) to obtain 0=0, as shown in the table.\n\nSecond, the dual form is useful when designing certain types of logic,\nsuch as the networks of transistors connecting the output of a CMOS\ngate to high voltage and ground.  If you look at the gate designs in\nthe textbook (and particularly those in the exercises),\nyou will notice that these networks are duals.  \n\nA function/expression is not a theorem nor an identity,\nthus the principle of duality does not apply to the dual of an\nexpression.\n\nHowever, if you treat the value 0 as ``true,'' the dual form of an\nexpression has the same truth values as the original (operating with\nvalue 1 as ``true'').\n\nFinally, you can calculate the complement of a Boolean function\n(any expression) by calculating the dual form and then complementing\neach variable.\n\n",

However, { any implementation of \na specification \nimplies decisions} about these details, so decisions should only be left \nunspecified if any of the possible answers is indeed acceptable.\n\nAs a concrete example, let's design logic to control an ice cream \ndispenser.  The dispenser has two flavors, lychee and mango, but\nalso allows us to create a blend of the two flavors.\nFor each of the two flavors, our logic must output two bits\nto control the amount of ice cream that comes out of the dispenser.\nThe two-bit C_L[1:0] output of our logic must specify the number \nof half-servings of lychee ice cream as a binary number, and\nthe two-bit C_M[1:0] output must specify the number of \nhalf-servings of mango ice cream.  Thus, for either flavor,\n00 indicates none of that flavor,\n01 indicates one-half of a serving, and \n10 indicates a full serving.\n\nInputs to our logic will consist of three buttons: an L button to\nrequest a serving of lychee ice cream, a B button to request a\nblend---half a serving of each flavor, and an M button to request\na serving of mango ice cream.  Each button produces a 1 \nwhen pressed and a 0 when not pressed.\n\n\n\nLet's start with the assumption that the user only presses one button\nat a time.  In this case, we can treat input combinations in which\nmore than one button is pressed as ``don't care'' values in the truth\ntables for the outputs.  K-maps for all four output bits appear below.\nThe x's indicate ``don't care'' values.\n\n\n\nWhen we calculate the logic function for an output, each ``don't care''\nvalue can be treated as either 0 or 1, whichever is more convenient\nin terms of creating the logic.  In the case of C_M[1], for \nexample, we can treat the three x's in the ellipse as 1s, treat the x\noutside of the ellipse as a 0, and simply\nuse M (the implicant represented by the ellipse) for C_M[1].  The\nother three output bits are left as an exercise, although the result \nappears momentarily.\n\n\nThe implementation at right takes full advantage of the ``don't care''\nparts of our specification.  In this case, we require no logic at all;\nwe need merely connect the inputs to the correct outputs.  Let's verify\nthe operation.  We have four cases to consider.  First, if none of the \nbuttons are pushed (LBM=000), we get no ice cream, as desired (C_M=00 \nand C_L=00).  Second, if we request lychee ice cream (LBM=100), the\noutputs are C_L=10 and C_M=00, so we get a full serving of lychee\nand no mango.  Third, if we request a blend (LBM=010), the outputs\nare C_L=01 and C_M=01, giving us half a serving of each flavor.\nFinally, if we request mango ice cream (LBM=001), we get no lychee\nbut a full serving of mango.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe K-maps for this implementation appear below.  Each of\nthe ``don't care'' x's from the original design has been replaced with\neither a 0 or a 1 and highlighted with shading and green italics.\nAny implementation produces \neither 0 or 1 for every output bit for every possible input combination.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}}\n\nAs you can see, leveraging ``don't care'' output bits can sometimes\nsignificantly simplify our logic.  In the case of this example, we were\nable to completely eliminate any need for gates!  Unfortunately, \nthe resulting implementation may sometimes produce unexpected results. \n\nBased on the implementation, what happens if a user presses more\nthan one button?  The ice cream cup overflows!\n\nLet's see why.\n\nConsider the case LBM=101, in which we've pressed both the lychee and\nmango buttons.  Here C_L=10 and C_M=10, so our dispenser releases a \nfull serving of each flavor, or two servings total.  Pressing other \ncombinations may have other repercussions as well.\nConsider pressing lychee and blend (LBM=110).  The outputs are then\nC_L=11 and C_M=01.  Hopefully the dispenser simply gives us one\nand a half servings of lychee and a half serving of mango.  However,\nif the person who designed the dispenser assumed that no one would ever\nask for more than one serving, something worse might happen.  In other\nwords, giving an input of C_L=11 to the ice cream dispenser may lead to\nother unexpected behavior if its designer decided that that input \npattern was a ``don't care.''\n\nThe root of the problem is that { while we don't care about the value of\nany particular output marked ``x'' for any particular input combination,\nwe do actually care about the relationship between the outputs}.  \n\nWhat can we do?  When in doubt, it is safest to make \nchoices and to add the new decisions to the specification rather than \nleaving output values specified as ``don't care.''\n\nFor our ice cream dispenser logic, rather than leaving the outputs \nunspecified whenever a user presses more than one button, we could \nchoose an acceptable outcome for each input combination and \nreplace the x's with 0s and 1s.  We might, for example, decide to\nproduce lychee ice cream whenever the lychee button is pressed, regardless\nof other buttons (LBM=1xx, which means that we don't care about the\ninputs B and M, so LBM=100, LBM=101, LBM=110, or LBM=111).  \nThat decision alone covers three of the\nfour unspecified input patterns.  We might also decide that when the \nblend and mango buttons are pushed together (but without the lychee\nbutton, LBM=011), our logic produces a blend.  \n\nThe resulting K-maps are shown below, again with shading and green italics \nidentifying\nthe combinations in which our original design specified ``don't care.''\n\n{{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-priority.eps,width=1.00in}}\n\n\nThe logic in the dashed box to the right implements the set of choices\njust discussed, and matches the K-maps above.\n\nBased on our additional choices, this implementation enforces\na strict priority scheme on the user's button presses.\n\nIf a user requests lychee, they can also press either or\nboth of the other buttons with no effect.  The lychee button has\npriority.  Similarly, if the user does not press lychee, but press-\n\n\n\n\n\nes the blend button, pressing the mango button at the same time has no\neffect.  Choosing mango requires that no other buttons be pressed.\nWe have thus chosen a prioritization order for the buttons and imposed \nthis order on the design.\n\nWe can view this same implementation in another way.\n\nNote the one-to-one correspondence between inputs (on the left) and \noutputs (on the right) for the dashed box.\n\nThis logic takes the user's button presses and chooses at most one of\nthe buttons to pass along to our original controller implementation \n(to the right of the dashed box).\n\nIn other words, rather than thinking of the logic in the dashed\nbox as implementing a specific set of decisions, we can think of the\nlogic as cleaning up the inputs to ensure that only valid\ncombinations are passed to our original implementation.\n\nOnce the inputs are cleaned up, the original implementation is \nacceptable, because input combinations containing more than a \nsingle 1 are in fact impossible.\n\nStrict prioritization is one useful way to clean up our inputs.\n\nIn general, we can design logic to map each\nof the four undesirable input patterns into one of the permissible \ncombinations (the\nfour that we specified explicitly in our original design, with LBM \nin the set ).  Selecting a prioritization scheme\nis just one approach for making these choices in a way\nthat is easy for a user to understand and \nis fairly easy to implement.\n\n\nA second simple approach is to ignore illegal\ncombinations by mapping them into the ``no buttons pressed'' \ninput pattern.\n\nSuch an implementation appears to the right, laid out to show that\none can again view the logic in the dashed box either as cleaning up \nthe inputs (by mentally grouping the logic with the inputs) or as a specific \nset of choices for our ``don't care'' output values (by grouping the \nlogic with the outputs).\n\nIn either case, the logic shown \nenforces our as-\n\n\n\n\n\nsumptions in a fairly conservative way:\nif a user presses more than one button, the logic squashes all button\npresses.  Only a single 1 value at a time can pass through to \nthe wires on the right of the figure.\n\n\n\nFor completeness, the K-maps corresponding to this implementation are given\nhere.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}}\n\n\n",

In other\nwords, giving an input of C_L=11 to the ice cream dispenser may lead to\nother unexpected behavior if its designer decided that that input \npattern was a ``don't care.''\n\nThe root of the problem is that { while we don't care about the value of\nany particular output marked ``x'' for any particular input combination,\nwe do actually care about the relationship between the outputs}.  \n\nWhat can we do?  When in doubt, it is safest to make \nchoices and to add the new decisions to the specification rather than \nleaving output values specified as ``don't care.''\n\nFor our ice cream dispenser logic, rather than leaving the outputs \nunspecified whenever a user presses more than one button, we could \nchoose an acceptable outcome for each input combination and \nreplace the x's with 0s and 1s.  We might, for example, decide to\nproduce lychee ice cream whenever the lychee button is pressed, regardless\nof other buttons (LBM=1xx, which means that we don't care about the\ninputs B and M, so LBM=100, LBM=101, LBM=110, or LBM=111).  \nThat decision alone covers three of the\nfour unspecified input patterns.  We might also decide that when the \nblend and mango buttons are pushed together (but without the lychee\nbutton, LBM=011), our logic produces a blend.  \n\nThe resulting K-maps are shown below, again with shading and green italics \nidentifying\nthe combinations in which our original design specified ``don't care.''\n\n{{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-priority.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-priority.eps,width=1.00in}}\n\n\nThe logic in the dashed box to the right implements the set of choices\njust discussed, and matches the K-maps above.\n\nBased on our additional choices, this implementation enforces\na strict priority scheme on the user's button presses.\n\nIf a user requests lychee, they can also press either or\nboth of the other buttons with no effect.  The lychee button has\npriority.  Similarly, if the user does not press lychee, but press-\n\n\n\n\n\nes the blend button, pressing the mango button at the same time has no\neffect.  Choosing mango requires that no other buttons be pressed.\nWe have thus chosen a prioritization order for the buttons and imposed \nthis order on the design.\n\nWe can view this same implementation in another way.\n\nNote the one-to-one correspondence between inputs (on the left) and \noutputs (on the right) for the dashed box.\n\nThis logic takes the user's button presses and chooses at most one of\nthe buttons to pass along to our original controller implementation \n(to the right of the dashed box).\n\nIn other words, rather than thinking of the logic in the dashed\nbox as implementing a specific set of decisions, we can think of the\nlogic as cleaning up the inputs to ensure that only valid\ncombinations are passed to our original implementation.\n\nOnce the inputs are cleaned up, the original implementation is \nacceptable, because input combinations containing more than a \nsingle 1 are in fact impossible.\n\nStrict prioritization is one useful way to clean up our inputs.\n\nIn general, we can design logic to map each\nof the four undesirable input patterns into one of the permissible \ncombinations (the\nfour that we specified explicitly in our original design, with LBM \nin the set ).  Selecting a prioritization scheme\nis just one approach for making these choices in a way\nthat is easy for a user to understand and \nis fairly easy to implement.\n\n\nA second simple approach is to ignore illegal\ncombinations by mapping them into the ``no buttons pressed'' \ninput pattern.\n\nSuch an implementation appears to the right, laid out to show that\none can again view the logic in the dashed box either as cleaning up \nthe inputs (by mentally grouping the logic with the inputs) or as a specific \nset of choices for our ``don't care'' output values (by grouping the \nlogic with the outputs).\n\nIn either case, the logic shown \nenforces our as-\n\n\n\n\n\nsumptions in a fairly conservative way:\nif a user presses more than one button, the logic squashes all button\npresses.  Only a single 1 value at a time can pass through to \nthe wires on the right of the figure.\n\n\n\nFor completeness, the K-maps corresponding to this implementation are given\nhere.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-conserve.eps,width=1.00in}}\n\n\n",

If we think\nof the form of an expression as a mapping from the function that we\nare trying to calculate into the AND, OR, and NOT functions that we\nuse as logical building blocks, we might also say that the first two\nversions use fewer building blocks.  That observation does have some\ntruth, but let's try to be more precise by framing a question.\n\nFor any given function, there are an infinite number of ways that we can\nexpress the function (for example, given one variable A on which the\nfunction depends, you can OR together any number of copies \nof A without changing the function).\n\n{ What exactly makes one expression better than another?}\n\n\n\nIn 1952, Edward Veitch wrote an article on simplifying truth functions.\nIn the introduction, he said, ``This general problem can be very complicated\nand difficult.  Not only does the complexity increase greatly with the\nnumber of inputs and outputs, but the criteria of the best circuit will\nvary with the equipment involved.''\n\nSixty years later, the answer is largely the same: the criteria depend\nstrongly on the underlying technology (the gates and the devices used\nto construct the gates), and no single { metric}, or way of measuring,\nis sufficient to capture the important differences between expressions \nin all cases.\n\nThree high-level metrics commonly used to evaluate chip\ndesigns are cost, power, and performance.  Cost usually represents the\nmanufacturing cost, which is closely related to the physical silicon\narea required for the design: the larger the chip, the more expensive\nthe chip is to produce.  Power measures energy consumption over\ntime.  A chip that consumes more power means that a user's energy bill\nis higher and, in a portable device, either that the device is heavier or has\na shorter battery life.  Performance measures the speed at which the\ndesign operates.  A faster design can offer more functionality, such as\nsupporting the latest games, or can just finish the same work in less\ntime than a slower design.  These metrics are sometimes related: if\na chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.\n\nHow do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only\nindirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make\ndirect calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of\nlogic expressions.  \n\nFinding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific\nlogic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the \ncomputational resources and algorithms available to us.\n\nInstead, tools typically use heuristic approaches\nto find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics.\nA { heuristic} approach is one that is\nbelieved to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does\nnot necessarily find an optimal solution.\n\nA human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as\nlimits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance,\nin order to guide the process.\n\nHuman engineers may also restructure the implementation of a \nlarger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic,\nso as to change the logic functions used in the design.\n\n{ Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of \noptimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must\nsupply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable \ntransformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt\nwork of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is\nbest to use in context.\n\nAlthough we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no\nlonger an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you\nshould be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for\nsuch optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is \nthreefold. \n\nFirst, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic\nlogic reformulations (slowly is acceptable)\nand logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two \nexpressions represent the same function?'').\n\nSecond, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you\nto real engineering.\n\nFinally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better\nunderstanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions\nthat form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly\nby humans today.\n\nTowards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two\nmetrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize \nlogic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided \ndesign} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies,\nbut the reasons for their use are still interesting.\n\nThe first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for\na design.\n\nThe measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in\nan expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see.\nUsing our example function C, \nEquation () gives a count of 6,\nEquation () gives a count of 8, and\nEquation () gives a count of 24.\nSmaller numbers represent better expressions, so \nEquation () is the best choice by this metric.\n\nWhy is this metric interesting?\nRecall how gates are built from transistors.\nAn {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you \ncount up the number of variables in the\nexpression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed,\nwhich is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.\n\nA variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations,\nsince each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between\ngates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations,\nso a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts\nas 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation\nfor this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes \navailable at no extra cost in gates or wires.\n\nIf we add the number of operations in our example, we get\na count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs,\nand 6 variables,\n\na count of 12 for Equation ()---three ANDS, one OR,\nand 8 variables,\n\nand a count of 31 for Equation ()---six ANDs, one OR,\nand 24 variables.\n\nThe relative differences between these equations \nare reduced when one counts operations.\n\nA second metric of interest is a heuristic for the performance of a design.\n\nPerformance is inversely related to the delay necessary for a design\nto produce an output once its inputs are available.  For example, if\nyou know how many seconds it takes to produce a result, you can easily\ncalculate the number of results that can be produced per second, which \nmeasures performance.\n\nThe measurement needed is the longest chain of operations\nperformed on any instance of a variable.  The complement of\na variable is included if the variable's complement is not \navailable without using an inverter.\n\nThe rationale for this metric is that gate outputs do not change \ninstantaneously when their inputs\nchange. Once an input to a gate has reached an appropriate voltage to represent \na 0 or a 1, the transistors in the gate switch (on or off) and electrons \nstart to move.\nOnly when the output of the gate reaches the appropriate new voltage \ncan the gates driven by the output start to change. \nIf we count each\nfunction/gate as one delay (we call this time a { gate delay}), we \nget an estimate of the time needed to compute\nthe function.\n\nReferring again to our example equations, we find that\nEquation () requires 3 gate delays,\nEquation () requires 2 gate delays,\nEquation () requires 2 or 3 gate delays, depending\non whether we have variable complements available.  Now \nEquation () looks more attractive: better performance than\nEquation () in return for a small extra cost in area.\n\nHeuristics for estimating energy use are too \ncomplex to introduce at this point, \nbut you should be aware that every time electrons move, they\ngenerate heat, so we might favor an expression that minimizes the number\nof bit transitions inside the computation.  Such a measurement is\nnot easy to calculate by hand,\nsince you need to know the likelihood of input combinations.\n\n\n",

That observation does have some\ntruth, but let's try to be more precise by framing a question.\n\nFor any given function, there are an infinite number of ways that we can\nexpress the function (for example, given one variable A on which the\nfunction depends, you can OR together any number of copies \nof A without changing the function).\n\n{ What exactly makes one expression better than another?}\n\n\n\nIn 1952, Edward Veitch wrote an article on simplifying truth functions.\nIn the introduction, he said, ``This general problem can be very complicated\nand difficult.  Not only does the complexity increase greatly with the\nnumber of inputs and outputs, but the criteria of the best circuit will\nvary with the equipment involved.''\n\nSixty years later, the answer is largely the same: the criteria depend\nstrongly on the underlying technology (the gates and the devices used\nto construct the gates), and no single { metric}, or way of measuring,\nis sufficient to capture the important differences between expressions \nin all cases.\n\nThree high-level metrics commonly used to evaluate chip\ndesigns are cost, power, and performance.  Cost usually represents the\nmanufacturing cost, which is closely related to the physical silicon\narea required for the design: the larger the chip, the more expensive\nthe chip is to produce.  Power measures energy consumption over\ntime.  A chip that consumes more power means that a user's energy bill\nis higher and, in a portable device, either that the device is heavier or has\na shorter battery life.  Performance measures the speed at which the\ndesign operates.  A faster design can offer more functionality, such as\nsupporting the latest games, or can just finish the same work in less\ntime than a slower design.  These metrics are sometimes related: if\na chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.\n\nHow do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only\nindirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make\ndirect calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of\nlogic expressions.  \n\nFinding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific\nlogic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the \ncomputational resources and algorithms available to us.\n\nInstead, tools typically use heuristic approaches\nto find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics.\nA { heuristic} approach is one that is\nbelieved to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does\nnot necessarily find an optimal solution.\n\nA human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as\nlimits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance,\nin order to guide the process.\n\nHuman engineers may also restructure the implementation of a \nlarger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic,\nso as to change the logic functions used in the design.\n\n{ Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of \noptimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must\nsupply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable \ntransformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt\nwork of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is\nbest to use in context.\n\nAlthough we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no\nlonger an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you\nshould be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for\nsuch optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is \nthreefold. \n\nFirst, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic\nlogic reformulations (slowly is acceptable)\nand logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two \nexpressions represent the same function?'').\n\nSecond, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you\nto real engineering.\n\nFinally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better\nunderstanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions\nthat form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly\nby humans today.\n\nTowards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two\nmetrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize \nlogic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided \ndesign} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies,\nbut the reasons for their use are still interesting.\n\nThe first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for\na design.\n\nThe measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in\nan expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see.\nUsing our example function C, \nEquation () gives a count of 6,\nEquation () gives a count of 8, and\nEquation () gives a count of 24.\nSmaller numbers represent better expressions, so \nEquation () is the best choice by this metric.\n\nWhy is this metric interesting?\nRecall how gates are built from transistors.\nAn {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you \ncount up the number of variables in the\nexpression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed,\nwhich is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.\n\nA variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations,\nsince each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between\ngates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations,\nso a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts\nas 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation\nfor this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes \navailable at no extra cost in gates or wires.\n\nIf we add the number of operations in our example, we get\na count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs,\nand 6 variables,\n\na count of 12 for Equation ()---three ANDS, one OR,\nand 8 variables,\n\nand a count of 31 for Equation ()---six ANDs, one OR,\nand 24 variables.\n\nThe relative differences between these equations \nare reduced when one counts operations.\n\nA second metric of interest is a heuristic for the performance of a design.\n\nPerformance is inversely related to the delay necessary for a design\nto produce an output once its inputs are available.  For example, if\nyou know how many seconds it takes to produce a result, you can easily\ncalculate the number of results that can be produced per second, which \nmeasures performance.\n\nThe measurement needed is the longest chain of operations\nperformed on any instance of a variable.  The complement of\na variable is included if the variable's complement is not \navailable without using an inverter.\n\nThe rationale for this metric is that gate outputs do not change \ninstantaneously when their inputs\nchange. Once an input to a gate has reached an appropriate voltage to represent \na 0 or a 1, the transistors in the gate switch (on or off) and electrons \nstart to move.\nOnly when the output of the gate reaches the appropriate new voltage \ncan the gates driven by the output start to change. \nIf we count each\nfunction/gate as one delay (we call this time a { gate delay}), we \nget an estimate of the time needed to compute\nthe function.\n\nReferring again to our example equations, we find that\nEquation () requires 3 gate delays,\nEquation () requires 2 gate delays,\nEquation () requires 2 or 3 gate delays, depending\non whether we have variable complements available.  Now \nEquation () looks more attractive: better performance than\nEquation () in return for a small extra cost in area.\n\nHeuristics for estimating energy use are too \ncomplex to introduce at this point, \nbut you should be aware that every time electrons move, they\ngenerate heat, so we might favor an expression that minimizes the number\nof bit transitions inside the computation.  Such a measurement is\nnot easy to calculate by hand,\nsince you need to know the likelihood of input combinations.\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Veitch Charts and Karnaugh Maps}\n\nVeitch's 1952 paper was the first to introduce the idea of\nusing a graphical representation to simplify logic expressions.\nEarlier approaches were algebraic.\nA year later, Maurice Karnaugh published\na paper showing a similar idea with a twist.  The twist makes the use of \n{ Karnaugh maps} to simplify expressions\nmuch easier than the use of Veitch charts.  As a result,\nfew engineers have heard of Veitch, but everyone who has ever\ntaken a class on digital logic knows how to make use of a { K-map}. \n\n\n\nBefore we introduce the Karnaugh map, let's think about the structure\nof the domain of a logic function.  Recall that a function's { domain}\nis the space on which the function is defined, that is, for which the\nfunction produces values.  For a Boolean logic function on N variables,\nyou can think of the domain as sequences of N bits, but you can also\nvisualize the domain as an {N-dimensional} hypercube.  \nAn\n\n\n\n\n\n{ {N-dimensional} hypercube} is the generalization\nof a cube to N dimensions.  Some people only use the term hypercube when\nN, since we have other names for the smaller values: a point\nfor N=0, a line segment for N=1, a square for N=2, and a cube\nfor N=3.  The diagrams above and to the right illustrate the cases that \nare easily drawn on paper.  The black dots represent specific input\ncombinations, and the blue edges connect input combinations that differ\nin exactly one input value (one bit).\n\n\n\nBy viewing a function's domain in this way, we can make a connection\nbetween a product of literals and the structure of the domain.  Let's\nuse the {3-dimensional} version as an example.  We call the \nvariables A, B, and C, and note that the cube has 2^3=8 corners\ncorresponding to the 2^3 possible combinations\nof A, B, and C.\nThe simplest product of literals in this\ncase is 1, which is the product of 0 literals.  Obviously, the product 1 \nevaluates to 1 for any variable values.  We can thus think of it as\ncovering the entire domain of the function.  In the case of our example,\nthe product 1 covers the whole cube.  In order for the product 1 to \nbe an implicant of a function, the function itself must be the function 1.\n\nWhat about a product consisting of a single literal, such as A \nor ?  The dividing lines in the diagram illustrate the\nanswer: any such product term evaluates to 1 on a face of the cube,\nwhich includes 2^2=4 of the corners.  If a function evaluates to 1\non any of the six faces of the cube, the corresponding product term\n(consisting of a single literal) is an implicant of the function.\n\nContinuing with products of two literals, we see that any product of \ntwo literals, such as A or C, corresponds\nto an edge of our {3-dimensional} cube.  The edge includes 2^1=2\ncorners.  And, if a function evaluates to 1 on any of the 12 edges\nof the cube, the corresponding product term (consisting of two literals)\nis an implicant of the function.\n\nFinally, any product of three literals, such as B,\ncorresponds to a corner of the cube.  But for a function on three variables,\nthese are just the minterms.  As you know, if a function evaluates to 1\non any of the 8 corners of the cube, that minterm is an implicant of the\nfunction (we used this idea to construct the function to prove\nlogical completeness).\n\nHow do these connections help us to simplify functions?  If we're\ncareful, we can map cubes onto paper in such a way that product terms\n(the possible implicants of the function) usually form contiguous \ngroups of 1s, allowing us to spot them easily.  Let's work upwards\nstarting from one variable to see how this idea works.  The end result\nis called a Karnaugh map.\n\n\nThe first drawing shown to the right replicates our view of \nthe {1-dimensional} hypercube, corresponding to the domain of a\nfunction on one variable, in this case the variable A.  \nTo the right of the hypercube (line segment) are two variants\nof a Karnaugh map on one variable.  The middle variant clearly \nindicates the column corresponding to the product A (the other \ncolumn corresponds to ).  The right variant simply labels\nthe column with values for A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three drawings shown to the right illustrate the three possible product\nterms on one variable.  { The functions shown in \nthese Karnaugh maps are arbitrary, except that we have chosen\nthem such that each implicant shown is a prime implicant for the\nillustrated function.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's now look at two-variable functions.  We have replicated\nour drawing of the {2-dimensional} hypercube (square) to the right \nalong with two variants of Karnaugh maps on two variables.\nWith only two variables (A and B), the extension is fairly \nstraightforward, since we can use the second dimension of the \npaper (vertical) to express the second variable (B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of possible products of literals grows rapidly with the \nnumber of variables.\nFor two variables, nine are possible, as shown to the right.\nNotice that all implicants have two properties.  First, they\noccupy contiguous regions of the grid.  And, second, their height\nand width are always powers of two.  These properties seem somewhat\ntrivial at this stage, but they are the key to the utility of\n{K-maps} on more variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-variable functions are next.  The cube diagram is again replicated\nto the right.  But now we have a problem: how can we map four points\n(say, from the top half of the cube) into a line in such a way that \nany points connected by a blue line are adjacent in the {K-map}?\nThe answer is that we cannot, but we can preserve most of the connections\nby choosing an order such as the one illustrated by the arrow.\nThe result\n\n\n\n\n\nis called a Gray code.  Two {K-map} variants again appear\nto the right of the cube.  Look closely at the order of the two-variable\ncombinations along the top, which allows us to have as many contiguous\nproducts of literals as possible.  Any product of literals that contains\n but not A nor  wraps around the edges\nof the {K-map}, so you should think of it as rolling up into a cylinder \nrather than a grid.  Or you can think that we're unfolding the cube to\nfit the corners onto a sheet of paper, but the place that we split\nthe cube should still be considered to be adjacent when looking for \nimplicants.  The use of a Gray code is the one difference between a\n{K-map} and a Veitch chart; Veitch used the base 2 order, which\nmakes some implicants hard to spot.\n\nWith three variables, we have 27 possible products of literals.  You\nmay have noticed that the count scales as 3^N for N variables;\ncan you explain why?  We illustrate several product terms\nbelow.  Note that we sometimes\nneed to wrap around the end of the {K-map}, but that if we account\nfor wrapping, the squares covered by all product terms are contiguous.\nAlso notice that both the width and the height of all product terms \nare powers of two.  { Any square or rectangle that meets these two \nconstraints corresponds to a product term!}  And any such square or \nrectangle that is filled with 1s is an implicant of the function\nin the {K-map}.\n\n\n\nLet's keep going.  With a function on four variables---A, B, C, \nand D---we can use a Gray code order on two of the variables in \neach dimension.  Which variables go with which dimension in the grid\nreally doesn't matter, so we'll assign AB to the horizontal dimension\nand CD to the vertical dimension.  A few of the 81 possible product\nterms are illustrated at the top of the next page.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{Veitch Charts and Karnaugh Maps}\n\nVeitch's 1952 paper was the first to introduce the idea of\nusing a graphical representation to simplify logic expressions.\nEarlier approaches were algebraic.\nA year later, Maurice Karnaugh published\na paper showing a similar idea with a twist.  The twist makes the use of \n{ Karnaugh maps} to simplify expressions\nmuch easier than the use of Veitch charts.  As a result,\nfew engineers have heard of Veitch, but everyone who has ever\ntaken a class on digital logic knows how to make use of a { K-map}. \n\n\n\nBefore we introduce the Karnaugh map, let's think about the structure\nof the domain of a logic function.  Recall that a function's { domain}\nis the space on which the function is defined, that is, for which the\nfunction produces values.  For a Boolean logic function on N variables,\nyou can think of the domain as sequences of N bits, but you can also\nvisualize the domain as an {N-dimensional} hypercube.  \nAn\n\n\n\n\n\n{ {N-dimensional} hypercube} is the generalization\nof a cube to N dimensions.  Some people only use the term hypercube when\nN, since we have other names for the smaller values: a point\nfor N=0, a line segment for N=1, a square for N=2, and a cube\nfor N=3.  The diagrams above and to the right illustrate the cases that \nare easily drawn on paper.  The black dots represent specific input\ncombinations, and the blue edges connect input combinations that differ\nin exactly one input value (one bit).\n\n\n\nBy viewing a function's domain in this way, we can make a connection\nbetween a product of literals and the structure of the domain.  Let's\nuse the {3-dimensional} version as an example.  We call the \nvariables A, B, and C, and note that the cube has 2^3=8 corners\ncorresponding to the 2^3 possible combinations\nof A, B, and C.\nThe simplest product of literals in this\ncase is 1, which is the product of 0 literals.  Obviously, the product 1 \nevaluates to 1 for any variable values.  We can thus think of it as\ncovering the entire domain of the function.  In the case of our example,\nthe product 1 covers the whole cube.  In order for the product 1 to \nbe an implicant of a function, the function itself must be the function 1.\n\nWhat about a product consisting of a single literal, such as A \nor ?  The dividing lines in the diagram illustrate the\nanswer: any such product term evaluates to 1 on a face of the cube,\nwhich includes 2^2=4 of the corners.  If a function evaluates to 1\non any of the six faces of the cube, the corresponding product term\n(consisting of a single literal) is an implicant of the function.\n\nContinuing with products of two literals, we see that any product of \ntwo literals, such as A or C, corresponds\nto an edge of our {3-dimensional} cube.  The edge includes 2^1=2\ncorners.  And, if a function evaluates to 1 on any of the 12 edges\nof the cube, the corresponding product term (consisting of two literals)\nis an implicant of the function.\n\nFinally, any product of three literals, such as B,\ncorresponds to a corner of the cube.  But for a function on three variables,\nthese are just the minterms.  As you know, if a function evaluates to 1\non any of the 8 corners of the cube, that minterm is an implicant of the\nfunction (we used this idea to construct the function to prove\nlogical completeness).\n\nHow do these connections help us to simplify functions?  If we're\ncareful, we can map cubes onto paper in such a way that product terms\n(the possible implicants of the function) usually form contiguous \ngroups of 1s, allowing us to spot them easily.  Let's work upwards\nstarting from one variable to see how this idea works.  The end result\nis called a Karnaugh map.\n\n\nThe first drawing shown to the right replicates our view of \nthe {1-dimensional} hypercube, corresponding to the domain of a\nfunction on one variable, in this case the variable A.  \nTo the right of the hypercube (line segment) are two variants\nof a Karnaugh map on one variable.  The middle variant clearly \nindicates the column corresponding to the product A (the other \ncolumn corresponds to ).  The right variant simply labels\nthe column with values for A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three drawings shown to the right illustrate the three possible product\nterms on one variable.  { The functions shown in \nthese Karnaugh maps are arbitrary, except that we have chosen\nthem such that each implicant shown is a prime implicant for the\nillustrated function.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's now look at two-variable functions.  We have replicated\nour drawing of the {2-dimensional} hypercube (square) to the right \nalong with two variants of Karnaugh maps on two variables.\nWith only two variables (A and B), the extension is fairly \nstraightforward, since we can use the second dimension of the \npaper (vertical) to express the second variable (B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of possible products of literals grows rapidly with the \nnumber of variables.\nFor two variables, nine are possible, as shown to the right.\nNotice that all implicants have two properties.  First, they\noccupy contiguous regions of the grid.  And, second, their height\nand width are always powers of two.  These properties seem somewhat\ntrivial at this stage, but they are the key to the utility of\n{K-maps} on more variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree-variable functions are next.  The cube diagram is again replicated\nto the right.  But now we have a problem: how can we map four points\n(say, from the top half of the cube) into a line in such a way that \nany points connected by a blue line are adjacent in the {K-map}?\nThe answer is that we cannot, but we can preserve most of the connections\nby choosing an order such as the one illustrated by the arrow.\nThe result\n\n\n\n\n\nis called a Gray code.  Two {K-map} variants again appear\nto the right of the cube.  Look closely at the order of the two-variable\ncombinations along the top, which allows us to have as many contiguous\nproducts of literals as possible.  Any product of literals that contains\n but not A nor  wraps around the edges\nof the {K-map}, so you should think of it as rolling up into a cylinder \nrather than a grid.  Or you can think that we're unfolding the cube to\nfit the corners onto a sheet of paper, but the place that we split\nthe cube should still be considered to be adjacent when looking for \nimplicants.  The use of a Gray code is the one difference between a\n{K-map} and a Veitch chart; Veitch used the base 2 order, which\nmakes some implicants hard to spot.\n\nWith three variables, we have 27 possible products of literals.  You\nmay have noticed that the count scales as 3^N for N variables;\ncan you explain why?  We illustrate several product terms\nbelow.  Note that we sometimes\nneed to wrap around the end of the {K-map}, but that if we account\nfor wrapping, the squares covered by all product terms are contiguous.\nAlso notice that both the width and the height of all product terms \nare powers of two.  { Any square or rectangle that meets these two \nconstraints corresponds to a product term!}  And any such square or \nrectangle that is filled with 1s is an implicant of the function\nin the {K-map}.\n\n\n\nLet's keep going.  With a function on four variables---A, B, C, \nand D---we can use a Gray code order on two of the variables in \neach dimension.  Which variables go with which dimension in the grid\nreally doesn't matter, so we'll assign AB to the horizontal dimension\nand CD to the vertical dimension.  A few of the 81 possible product\nterms are illustrated at the top of the next page.  Notice that while wrapping \ncan now occur\nin both dimensions, we have exactly the same rule for finding implicants\nof the function: any square or rectangle (allowing for wrapping) \nthat is filled with 1s and has both height and width equal to (possibly\ndifferent) powers of two is an implicant of the function.  { \nFurthermore, unless such a square or rectangle is part of a larger\nsquare or rectangle that meets these criteria, the corresponding\nimplicant is a prime implicant of the function.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding a simple expression for a function using a {K-map} then\nconsists of solving the following problem: pick a minimal set of prime \nimplicants such that every 1 produced by the function is covered\nby at least one prime implicant.

It also involves applying strategies such as making use of human algorithms and bit-slicing to simplify design problems. Additionally, two-level logic requires an understanding of tradeoffs between cost/area and performance when designing circuits."

In this section, we illustrate one of the \nreasons for this popularity and \nshow you how to graphically manipulate\nexpressions, which can sometimes help when trying to understand gate\ndiagrams.\n\nWe begin with one of DeMorgan's laws, which we can illustrate both \nalgebraically and graphically:\nC  =  B+A  =   \n\n\n{file=part2/figs/demorgan-nand.eps,width=0.95in}\n\n\n\n\nLet's say that we have a function expressed in SOP form, such as\nZ=ABC+DE+FGHJ.  The diagram on the left below shows the function\nconstructed from three AND gates and an OR gate.  Using DeMorgan's\nlaw, we can replace the OR gate with a NAND with inverted inputs.\nBut the bubbles that correspond to inversion do not need to sit at the\ninput to the gate.  We can invert at any point along the wire,\nso we slide each bubble down the wire to the output of the first column\nof AND gates.  { Be careful: if the wire splits, which does not\nhappen in our example, you have to replicate\nthe inverter onto the other output paths as you slide past the split\npoint!}  The end result is shown on the right: we have not changed the \nfunction, but now we use only NAND gates.

Becoming a good\nengineer thus requires not only that you be able to solve problems\ncreatively so as to improve the quality of your solutions, but also\nthat you are aware of how people might evaluate those solutions and\nare able both to identify the most important metrics and to balance \nyour design effectively according to them.  In this section, we\nintroduce some general ideas and methods that may be of use to you\nin this regard.\n\n{ We will not test you on the concepts in this section.}\n\nWhen you start thinking about a new problem, your first step\nshould be to think carefully about metrics of possible interest.\n\nSome important metrics may not be easy to quantify.  \n\nFor example, compatibility of a design with other products already \nowned by a customer has frequently defined the success or failure\nof computer hardware and software solutions.\n\nBut how can you compute the compability of your approach as\na number?\n\nHumans---including engineers---are not good at\ncomparing multiple metrics simultaneously.\n\nThus, once you have a set of metrics that you feel is complete, \nyour next step is to get rid of as many as you can.\n\nTowards this end, you may identify metrics that have no practical \nimpact in current technology, set threshold values for other metrics\nto simplify reasoning about them, eliminate redundant metrics,\ncalculate linear sums to reduce the count of metrics, and, finally,\nmake use of the notion of Pareto optimality.  All of these ideas are\ndescribed in the rest of this section.\n\nLet's start by considering metrics that we can quantify as real\nnumbers.\n\nFor a given metric, we can divide possible measurement values into\nthree ranges.\n\nIn the first range,\nall measurement values are equivalently useful.\nIn the second range, \npossible values are ordered and interesting with respect to\none another.\nValues in the third range are all impossible to use in practice.\nUsing power consumption as\nour example, the first range corresponds to systems in which\nwhen a processor's power consumption in a digital \nsystem is extremely low relative to the\npower consumption\nof the system.\nFor example, the processor in a computer might use less than 1 \nof the total used by \nthe system including the disk drive, the monitor, the power \nsupply, and so forth.  One power consumption value in this range \nis just as good as any\nanother, and no one cares about the power consumption of the processor \nin such cases.  In the second range, power consumption of the\nprocessor makes a difference.  Cell phones use most of their energy\nin radio operation, for example, but if you own a phone with a powerful\nprocessor, you may have noticed that you can turn off the phone and \ndrain the battery fairly quickly by playing a game.  Designing a\nprocessor that uses half as much power lengthens the battery life in\nsuch cases.  Finally,\nthe third region of power consumption measurements is impossible:\nif you use so much power, your chip will overheat or even burst\ninto flames.  Consumers get unhappy when such things happen.\n\nAs a first step, you can remove any metrics for which all solutions\nare effectively equivalent.\n\nUntil a little less than a decade ago, for example, the power \nconsumption of a desktop\nprocessor actually was in the first range that we discussed.  Power\nwas simply not a concern to engineers: all designs of \ninterest consumed so little power that no one cared.\n\nUnfortunately, at that point, power consumption jumped into the\nthird range rather quickly.  Processors hit a wall, and \nproducts had to be cancelled.  Given that the time spent designing\na processor has historically\nbeen about five years, a lot of engineering effort\nwas wasted because people had not thought carefully enough about\npower (since it had never mattered in the past).\n\nToday, power is an important metric that engineers must take into\naccount in their designs. \n\nHowever, in some areas, such as desktop and high-end server\nprocessors,\nother metrics (such as performance) may be so \nimportant that we always want to operate at the edge of the\ninteresting range.  In such cases, we might choose to treat \na metric such as power consumption as a { threshold}: stay\nbelow 150 Watts for a desktop processor, for example.  One still\nhas to make a coordinated effort to ensure that the system as\na whole does not exceed the threshold, but reasoning about \nthreshold values, a form of constraint, is easier than trying to\nthink about multiple metrics at once.\n\nSome metrics may only allow discrete quantification.  For example,\none could choose to define compatibility with previous processor\ngenerations as binary: either an existing piece of software\n(or operating system)\nruns out of the box on your new processor, or it does not.  If you \nwant people who own that software to make use of your new processor,\nyou must ensure that the value of this binary metric is 1, which\ncan also be viewed as a threshold.\n\nIn some cases, two metrics may be strongly { correlated}, meaning\nthat a design that is good for one of the metrics is frequently \ngood for the other metric as well.\n\nChip area and cost, for\nexample, are technically distinct ways to measure a digital design,\nbut we rarely consider them separately.\n\nA design that requires a larger chip is probably more complex,\nand thus takes more engineering time to get right (engineering time\ncosts money).  \n\nEach silicon wafer costs money to fabricate, and fewer copies of a \nlarge design fit on one wafer, so large chips mean more fabrication\ncost.\n\nPhysical defects in silicon can cause some chips not to work.  A large\nchip uses more silicon than a small one, and is thus more likely to suffer\nfrom defects (and not work).  Cost thus goes up again for large chips\nrelative to small ones.\n\nFinally, large chips usually require more careful testing to ensure\nthat they work properly (even ignoring the cost of getting the design\nright, we have to test for the presence of defects), which adds still\nmore cost for a larger chip.\n\nAll of these factors tend to correlate chip area and chip cost, to the\npoint that most engineers do not consider both metrics.\n\n\nAfter you have tried to reduce your set of metrics as much as possible,\nor simplified them by turning them into thresholds, you should consider\nturning the last few metrics into a weighted linear sum.  All remaining\nmetrics must be quantifiable in this case.\n\nFor example, if you are left with three metrics for which a given\ndesign has values A, B, and C, you might reduce these to one\nmetric by calculating D=w_AA+w_BB+w_CC.  What are the w values?\nThey are weights for the three metrics.  Their values represent the\nrelative importance of the three metrics to the overall evaluation.\nHere we've assumed that larger values of A, B, and C are either\nall good or all bad.  If you have metrics with different senses,\nuse the reciprocal values.  For example, if a large value of A is good,\na small value of 1/A is also good.  \n\nThe difficulty with linearizing metrics is that not everyone agrees\non the weights.  Is using less power more important than having a cheaper\nchip?  The answer may depend on many factors.\n\nWhen you are left with several metrics of interest, you can use the\nidea of Pareto optimality to identify interesting designs.\n\nLet's say that you have two metrics.  If a design D_1 is better than\na second design D_2 for both metrics, we say that D_1 \n{ dominates} D_2.\n\nA design D is then said to be { Pareto optimal} if no other design\ndominates D.  Consider the figure on the left below, which illustrates\nseven possible designs measured with two metrics.  The design corresponding\nto point B dominates the designs corresponding to points A and C, so \nneither of the latter designs is Pareto optimal.  No other point \nin the figure dominates B, however, so that design is Pareto optimal.\nIf we remove all points that do not represent Pareto optimal designs,\nand instead include only those designs that are Pareto optimal, we\nobtain the version shown on the right.  These are points in a two-dimensional\nspace, not a line, but we can imagine a line going through the points,\nas illustrated in the figure: the points that make up the line are\ncalled a { Pareto curve}, or, if you have more than two metrics,\na { Pareto surface}.\n\n{\n\n\n\n\nAs an example of the use of Pareto optimality, consider the figure\nto the right, which is copied with permission from Neal Crago's Ph.D. \ndissertation (UIUC ECE, 2012).  The figure compares hundreds of thousands \nof possible\ndesigns based on a handful of different core approaches for\nimplementing a processor.  The axes in the graph are two metrics \nof interest.  The horizontal axis measures the average performance of a \ndesign when\nexecuting a set of benchmark applications, normalized to\na baseline processor design.

Other variants of flip-flops have also been built, but this \ntype dominates designs today.  Most are actually generated automatically\nfrom hardware ``design'' languages (that is, computer programming languages\nfor hardware design).\n\nWhen the clock is low (0), the first latch copies its value from\nthe flip-flop's D input to the midpoint (marked X in our figure, but\nnot usually given a name).  When the clock is high (1), the second\nlatch copies its value from X to the flip-flop's output Q.\nSince X can not change when the clock is high,\nthe result is that the output changes each time the clock changes\nfrom 0 to 1, which is called the { rising edge} or { positive edge}\n(the derivative) of the clock signal.  Hence the qualifier \n``positive edge-triggered,'' which describes the flip-flop's behavior.\n\nThe ``master-slave'' implementation refers to the use of two latches.\n\nThe ``dual-latch'' implementation refers to the use of two \nlatches.{Historically, this implementation was called ``master-slave,''\nbut ECE Illinois has decided to eliminate use of such terminology.}\nlatches.\nIn practice, flip-flops are almost never built this way.  To see a \ncommercial design, look up 74LS74, which uses six {3-input} NAND\ngates and allows set/reset of the flip-flop (using two\nextra inputs).\n\n\n\nThe { timing diagram} to the right illustrates the operation of\nour flip-flop.  In a timing diagram, the horizontal axis represents\n(continuous) increasing time, and the individual lines represent\nvoltages for logic signals.  The relatively simple version shown here\nuses only binary values for each signal.  One can also draw \ntransitions more realistically (as taking finite time).  The dashed\nvertical lines here represent the times at which the clock rises.\nTo make the\n\n\n\n\n\nexample interesting, we have varied D over two clock\ncycles.  Notice that even though D rises and falls during the second\nclock cycle, its value is not copied to the output of our flip-flop.\nOne can build flip-flops that ``catch'' this kind of behavior\n(and change to output 1), but we leave such designs for later in your\ncareer.\n\nCircuits such as latches and flip-flops are called { sequential\nfeedback} circuits, and the process by which they are designed \nis beyond the scope of our course.  The ``feedback'' part of the\nname refers to the fact that the outputs of some gates are fed back \ninto the inputs of others.  Each cycle in a sequential feedback \ncircuit can store one bit.\n\nCircuits that merely use\nlatches and flip-flops as building blocks are called\n{ clocked synchronous sequential circuits}.  Such designs are\nstill sequential: their behavior depends on the bits currently\nstored in the latches and flip-flops.  However, their behavior\nis substantially simplified by the use of a clock signal (the ``clocked''\npart of the name) in a way that all elements change at the same\ntime (``synchronously'').\n\nThe value of using flip-flops and assuming a square-wave\nclock signal with uniform timing may not be clear to you yet,\nbut it bears emphasis.\n\nWith such assumptions, { we can treat time as having \ndiscrete values.}  In other words, time ``ticks'' along discretely,\nlike integers instead of real numbers.\n\nWe can look at the state of the system, calculate the inputs to our\nflip-flops through the combinational logic that drives their D\ninputs, and be confident that, when time moves to the next discrete\nvalue, we will know the new bit values stored in our flip-flops,\nallowing us to repeat the process for the next clock cycle without\nworrying about exactly when things change.  Values change only\non the rising edge of the clock!\n\nReal systems, of course, are not so simple, and we do not have one\nclock to drive the universe, so engineers must also design systems\nthat interact even though each has its own private clock signal\n(usually with different periods).\n\n\n\n",

Other variants of flip-flops have also been built, but this \ntype dominates designs today.  Most are actually generated automatically\nfrom hardware ``design'' languages (that is, computer programming languages\nfor hardware design).\n\nWhen the clock is low (0), the first latch copies its value from\nthe flip-flop's D input to the midpoint (marked X in our figure, but\nnot usually given a name).  When the clock is high (1), the second\nlatch copies its value from X to the flip-flop's output Q.\nSince X can not change when the clock is high,\nthe result is that the output changes each time the clock changes\nfrom 0 to 1, which is called the { rising edge} or { positive edge}\n(the derivative) of the clock signal.  Hence the qualifier \n``positive edge-triggered,'' which describes the flip-flop's behavior.\n\nThe ``master-slave'' implementation refers to the use of two latches.\n\nThe ``dual-latch'' implementation refers to the use of two \nlatches.{Historically, this implementation was called ``master-slave,''\nbut ECE Illinois has decided to eliminate use of such terminology.}\nlatches.\nIn practice, flip-flops are almost never built this way.  To see a \ncommercial design, look up 74LS74, which uses six {3-input} NAND\ngates and allows set/reset of the flip-flop (using two\nextra inputs).\n\n\n\nThe { timing diagram} to the right illustrates the operation of\nour flip-flop.  In a timing diagram, the horizontal axis represents\n(continuous) increasing time, and the individual lines represent\nvoltages for logic signals.  The relatively simple version shown here\nuses only binary values for each signal.  One can also draw \ntransitions more realistically (as taking finite time).  The dashed\nvertical lines here represent the times at which the clock rises.\nTo make the\n\n\n\n\n\nexample interesting, we have varied D over two clock\ncycles.  Notice that even though D rises and falls during the second\nclock cycle, its value is not copied to the output of our flip-flop.\nOne can build flip-flops that ``catch'' this kind of behavior\n(and change to output 1), but we leave such designs for later in your\ncareer.\n\nCircuits such as latches and flip-flops are called { sequential\nfeedback} circuits, and the process by which they are designed \nis beyond the scope of our course.  The ``feedback'' part of the\nname refers to the fact that the outputs of some gates are fed back \ninto the inputs of others.  Each cycle in a sequential feedback \ncircuit can store one bit.\n\nCircuits that merely use\nlatches and flip-flops as building blocks are called\n{ clocked synchronous sequential circuits}.  Such designs are\nstill sequential: their behavior depends on the bits currently\nstored in the latches and flip-flops.  However, their behavior\nis substantially simplified by the use of a clock signal (the ``clocked''\npart of the name) in a way that all elements change at the same\ntime (``synchronously'').\n\nThe value of using flip-flops and assuming a square-wave\nclock signal with uniform timing may not be clear to you yet,\nbut it bears emphasis.\n\nWith such assumptions, { we can treat time as having \ndiscrete values.}  In other words, time ``ticks'' along discretely,\nlike integers instead of real numbers.\n\nWe can look at the state of the system, calculate the inputs to our\nflip-flops through the combinational logic that drives their D\ninputs, and be confident that, when time moves to the next discrete\nvalue, we will know the new bit values stored in our flip-flops,\nallowing us to repeat the process for the next clock cycle without\nworrying about exactly when things change.  Values change only\non the rising edge of the clock!\n\nReal systems, of course, are not so simple, and we do not have one\nclock to drive the universe, so engineers must also design systems\nthat interact even though each has its own private clock signal\n(usually with different periods).\n\n\n\n",

        "textbook-paragraph": "{The Multiplexer}\n\nUsing the more abstract designs for checking ranges of ASCII characters,\nwe can go a step further and create a checker for both upper- and lower-case\nletters.  To do so, we add another input S that allows us to select the \nfunction that we want---either the upper-case checker U(C) or the \nlower-case checker L(C).\n\nFor this purpose, we make use of a logic block called a { multiplexer},\nor { mux}.\nMultiplexers are an important abstraction for digital logic.  In \ngeneral, a multiplexer allows us to use one digital signal to \nselect which of several others is forwarded to an output.\n\n\nThe simplest form of the multiplexer is the 2-to-1 multiplexer shown to \nthe right.   The logic diagram illustrates how the mux works.  The block \nhas two inputs from the left and one from the top.  The top input allows \nus to choose which of the left inputs is forwarded to the output.  \nWhen the input S=0, the upper AND gate outputs 0, and the lower AND gate\noutputs the value of D_0.  The OR gate then produces Q=0+D_0=D_0.\nSimilarly, when input S=1, the upper AND gate outputs D_1, and the\nlower AND gate outputs 0.  In this case, the OR gate produces Q=D_1+0=D_1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symbolic form of the mux is a trapezoid with data inputs on the \nlarger side, an output on the smaller side, and a select input on the\nangled part of the trapezoid.  The labels inside the trapezoid indicate \nthe value of the select input S for which the adjacent data signal, \nD_1 or D_0, is copied to the output Q.\n\nWe can generalize multiplexers in two ways.  First, we can extend the \nsingle select input to a group of select inputs.  An {N-bit}\nselect input allows selection from amongst 2^N inputs.  A {4-to-1} \nmultiplexer is shown below, for example.  The logic diagram on the left\nshows how the {4-to-1 mux} operates.  For any combination of S_1S_0,\nthree of the AND gates produce 0, and the fourth outputs the D input\ncorresponding to the interpretation of S as an unsigned number.\nGiven three zeroes and one D input, the OR gate thus reproduces one of \nthe D's.  When S_1S_0=10, for example, the third AND gate copies D_2,\nand Q=D_2.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/mux4-to-1.eps,width=5.60in}}\n\nAs shown in the middle figure, a {4-to-1} mux can also be built from\nthree {2-to-1} muxes.

        "textbook-paragraph": "{The Multiplexer}\n\nUsing the more abstract designs for checking ranges of ASCII characters,\nwe can go a step further and create a checker for both upper- and lower-case\nletters.  To do so, we add another input S that allows us to select the \nfunction that we want---either the upper-case checker U(C) or the \nlower-case checker L(C).\n\nFor this purpose, we make use of a logic block called a { multiplexer},\nor { mux}.\nMultiplexers are an important abstraction for digital logic.  In \ngeneral, a multiplexer allows us to use one digital signal to \nselect which of several others is forwarded to an output.\n\n\nThe simplest form of the multiplexer is the 2-to-1 multiplexer shown to \nthe right.   The logic diagram illustrates how the mux works.  The block \nhas two inputs from the left and one from the top.  The top input allows \nus to choose which of the left inputs is forwarded to the output.  \nWhen the input S=0, the upper AND gate outputs 0, and the lower AND gate\noutputs the value of D_0.  The OR gate then produces Q=0+D_0=D_0.\nSimilarly, when input S=1, the upper AND gate outputs D_1, and the\nlower AND gate outputs 0.  In this case, the OR gate produces Q=D_1+0=D_1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symbolic form of the mux is a trapezoid with data inputs on the \nlarger side, an output on the smaller side, and a select input on the\nangled part of the trapezoid.  The labels inside the trapezoid indicate \nthe value of the select input S for which the adjacent data signal, \nD_1 or D_0, is copied to the output Q.\n\nWe can generalize multiplexers in two ways.  First, we can extend the \nsingle select input to a group of select inputs.  An {N-bit}\nselect input allows selection from amongst 2^N inputs.  A {4-to-1} \nmultiplexer is shown below, for example.  The logic diagram on the left\nshows how the {4-to-1 mux} operates.  For any combination of S_1S_0,\nthree of the AND gates produce 0, and the fourth outputs the D input\ncorresponding to the interpretation of S as an unsigned number.\nGiven three zeroes and one D input, the OR gate thus reproduces one of \nthe D's.  When S_1S_0=10, for example, the third AND gate copies D_2,\nand Q=D_2.\n\n{{file=part2/figs/mux4-to-1.eps,width=5.60in}}\n\nAs shown in the middle figure, a {4-to-1} mux can also be built from\nthree {2-to-1} muxes.

We begin with\nthe functions that we illustrated with the first truth table from this\nset of notes,\nthe carry out C and sum S of two {2-bit}\nunsigned numbers.  Since each output bit requires a separate expression,\nwe now write S_1S_0 for the two bits of the sum.  We also need to\nbe able to make use of the individual bits of the input values, so we \nwrite these as A_1A_0 and B_1B_0, as shown on the left below.\nUsing our \nconstruction from the logical completeness theorem, we obtain the\nequations on the right.\nYou should verify these expressions yourself.\n\n{\n\n{cccc|ccc}\n{c|}& \nA_1& A_0& B_1& B_0& C& S_1& S_0 \n0&0& 0&0& 0& 0&0\n0&0& 0&1& 0& 0&1\n0&0& 1&0& 0& 1&0\n0&0& 1&1& 0& 1&1\n0&1& 0&0& 0& 0&1\n0&1& 0&1& 0& 1&0\n0&1& 1&0& 0& 1&1\n0&1& 1&1& 1& 0&0\n1&0& 0&0& 0& 1&0\n1&0& 0&1& 0& 1&1\n1&0& 1&0& 1& 0&0\n1&0& 1&1& 1& 0&1\n1&1& 0&0& 0& 1&1\n1&1& 0&1& 1& 0&0\n1&1& 1&0& 1& 0&1\n1&1& 1&1& 1& 1&0\n\n\n\n{eqnarray*}\n\nC &=& \n{A_1} A_0 B_1 B_0 +\nA_1 {A_0} B_1 {B_0} +\nA_1 {A_0} B_1 B_0 +\n&& A_1 A_0 {B_1} B_0 +\nA_1 A_0 B_1 {B_0} +\nA_1 A_0 B_1 B_0\n\n\nS_1 &=& \n{A_1} {A_0} B_1 {B_0} +\n{A_1} {A_0} B_1 B_0 +\n{A_1} A_0 {B_1} B_0 +\n&& {A_1} A_0 B_1 {B_0} +\nA_1 {A_0} {B_1} {B_0} +\nA_1 {A_0} {B_1} B_0 +\n&& A_1 A_0 {B_1} {B_0} +\nA_1 A_0 B_1 B_0\n\n\nS_0 &=& \n{A_1} {A_0} {B_1} B_0 +\n{A_1} {A_0} B_1 B_0 +\n{A_1} A_0 {B_1} {B_0} +\n&& {A_1} A_0 B_1 {B_0} +\nA_1 {A_0} {B_1} B_0 +\nA_1 {A_0} B_1 B_0 +\n&& A_1 A_0 {B_1} {B_0} +\nA_1 A_0 B_1 {B_0}\n{eqnarray*}\n\n}\n\n\nNow let's consider a new function.  Given\nan {8-bit} 2's complement number, A=A_7A_6A_5A_4A_3A_2A_1A_0,\nwe want to compare it with the value -1.  We know that\nwe can construct this function using AND, OR, and NOT, but how?\nWe start by writing the representation for -1, which is 11111111.\nIf the number A matches that representation, we want to produce a 1.\nIf the number A differs in any bit, we want to produce a 0.\nThe desired function has exactly one combination of inputs that\nproduces a 1, so in fact we need only one minterm!  In this case, we\ncan compare with -1 by calculating the expression:\n\n{eqnarray*}\nA_7  A_6  A_5  A_4  A_3  A_2  A_1  A_0\n{eqnarray*}\n\nHere we have explicitly included multiplication symbols to avoid\nconfusion with our notation for groups of bits, as we used when \nnaming the individual bits of A.\n\n\nIn closing, we briefly introduce a generalization of logic\noperations to groups of bits.  Our representations for integers,\nreal numbers, and characters from human languages all use more than\none bit to represent a given value.  When we use computers, we often\nmake use of multiple bits in groups in this way.  A { byte}, for example,\ntoday means an ordered group of eight bits.\n\nWe can extend our logic functions to operate on such groups by pairing\nbits from each of two groups and performing the logic operation on each\npair.  For example, given\nA=A_7A_6A_5A_4A_3A_2A_1A_0=01010101\nand\nB=B_7B_6B_5B_4B_3B_2B_1B_0=11110000, we calculate\nA AND B by computing the AND of each pair of bits, \nA_7 AND B_7,\nA_6 AND B_6,\nand so forth, to\nproduce the result 01010000, as shown to the right.\nIn the same way, we can extend other logic\noperations, such as OR, NOT, and XOR, to operate on bits of groups.\n\n\n{ 0pt\n 0pt\n\n&A  & 0&1& 0&1& 0&1& 0&1\n  AND   &B& 1&1&1&1&0&0&0&0 \n&& 0& 1&0&1&0&0&0&0\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
