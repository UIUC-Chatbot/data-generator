    "textbook-paragraph": "{Finite State Machine Design Examples, Part I}  This set of notes uses a series of examples to illustrate design principles  for the implementation of finite state machines (FSMs) using digital logic. We begin with an overview of the design process for a digital FSM, from the development of an abstract model through the implementation of functions for the next-state variables and output signals. Our first few examples cover only the concrete aspects: we implement several counters, which illustrate the basic  process of translating a concrete and complete state transition diagram into an implementation based on flip-flops and logic gates. We next consider a counter with a number of states that is not a power of two, with which we illustrate the need for FSM initialization.  As part of solving the initialization problem, we also introduce   a general form of selection logic called a multiplexer.  We then consider the design process as a whole through a more general example of a counter with multiple inputs to control its behavior.  We work from an abstract model down to an implementation, illustrating how semantic knowledge from the abstract model can be used to simplify the  implementation.  Finally, we illustrate how the choice of representation for the FSM's internal state affects the complexity of the implementation. Fortunately, designs that are more intuitive and easier for humans to understand also typically make the best designs in terms of  other metrics, such as logic complexity.   {Steps in the Design Process}  Before we begin exploring designs, let's talk briefly about the general approach that we take when designing an FSM.  We follow a six-step process:{-8pt}  {{}{} {}{}{} {develop an abstract model}{step-abs} {specify I/O behavior}{step-io} {complete the specification}{step-complete} {choose a state representation}{step-repn} {calculate logic expressions}{step-logic} {implement with flip-flops and gates}{step-gates} } {-8pt}  In Step {step-abs}, we translate our description in human language into a model with states and desired behavior.  At this stage, we  simply try to capture the intent of the description and are not particularly thorough nor exact.  Step {step-io} begins to formalize the model, starting with its input and output behavior.  If we eventually plan to develop an implementation of our FSM as a digital system (which is not the  only choice, of course!), all input and output must consist of bits.  Often, input and/or output specifications may need to match other digital systems to which we plan to connect our FSM.  In fact, { most problems in developing large digital systems today arise because of incompatibilities when composing two or more separately designed pieces} (or { modules}) into an integrated system.  Once we know the I/O behavior for our FSM, in Step {step-complete} we start to make any implicit assumptions clear and to make any other decisions necessary to the design.  Occasionally, we may choose to leave something undecided in the hope of simplifying the design with ``don't care'' entries in the logic formulation.  In Step {step-repn}, we select an internal representation for the bits necessary to encode the state of our FSM.  In practice, for small designs, this representation can be selected by a computer  in such a way as to optimize the implementation.  However, for large designs, such as the LC-3 instruction set architecture that we study later in this class, humans do most of the work by hand.  In the later examples in this set of notes, we show how even a  small design can leverage meaningful information from the design when selecting the representation, leading to an implementation that is simpler and is easier to build correctly.  We also show how one can use abstraction to simplify an implementation.  By Step {step-logic}, our design is a complete specification in terms of bits, and we need merely derive logic expressions for the next-state variables and the output signals.",

As you know, the ISA defines the interface between software and hardware, abstracting the capabilities of a computer's datapath and standardizing the format of instructions to utilize those capabilities.  Successful ISAs are rarely discarded, as success implies the existence of large amounts of software built to use the ISA.  Rather, they are extended, and their original forms must be supported for decades (consider, for example, the IBM 360 and the Intel x86).  Employing sound design principles is thus imperative in an ISA.  {Formats and Fields*}  The LC-3 ISA  employs fixed-length instructions and a load-store architecture, two aspects that help to reduce the design space to a manageable set of choices.  In a general ISA design, many other options exist for instruction formats.  Recall the idea of separating the bits of an instruction into (possibly non-contiguous) fields.  One of the fields must contain an opcode, which specifies the type of operation to be performed by the instruction.  In the {LC-3} ISA, most opcodes specify both the type of operation and the types of arguments to the operation.   More generally, many addressing modes are possible for each operand, and we can think of the bits that specify the addressing mode as a separate field, known as the { mode} field.    As a simple example, the {LC-3's} ADD and AND instructions  contain a {1-bit} mode field that specifies whether the second operand of the ADD/AND comes from a register or is an immediate value.  Several questions must be answered in order to define the possible instruction formats for an ISA.  First, are instructions fixed-length or variable-length?  Second, how many addresses are needed for each instruction, and how many of the addresses can be memory addresses? Finally, what forms of addresses are possible for each operand? For example, can one use full memory addresses or only limited offsets relative to a register?  The answer to the first question depends on many factors, but several clear advantages exist for both answers.  { Fixed-length instructions} are easy to fetch and decode.  A",

    "textbook-paragraph": "K-maps, we must start again with new K-maps for the lower-case checker.  If instead we have taken the approach of designing logic for the upper and  lower bits of the ASCII character, we can reuse most of that logic, since the functions T_4 and T_5 are identical when checking for a lower-case character.  Recalling the algebraic form of U(C), we can then write a function L(C) (a lower-case checker) as shown on the left below.   {eqnarray*} U&=&C_6 {C_5} {C_4} T_4+C_6 {C_5} C_4 T_5  L&=&C_6 C_5 {C_4} T_4+C_6 C_5 C_4 T_5  &=&C_6 C_5 {C_4} (C_3+C_2+C_1+C_0)+ &&C_6 C_5 C_4 ({C_3}+{C_2} {C_1}+{C_2} {C_0}) {eqnarray*}   {file=part2/figs/ascii-cmp-lower.eps,width=3.6in}   Finally, if we have used a design based on comparators or adders, the design of a lower-case checker becomes trivial: simply change the numbers that we input to these components, as shown in the figure on the right above for the comparator-based design.  The only changes from the upper-case checker design are the inputs to the comparators and the output produced,  highlighted with blue text in the figure.    {The Multiplexer}  Using the more abstract designs for checking ranges of ASCII characters, we can go a step further and create a checker for both upper- and lower-case letters.  To do so, we add another input S that allows us to select the  function that we want---either the upper-case checker U(C) or the  lower-case checker L(C).  For this purpose, we make use of a logic block called a { multiplexer}, or { mux}. Multiplexers are an important abstraction for digital logic.  In  general, a multiplexer allows us to use one digital signal to  select which of several others is forwarded to an output.   The simplest form of the multiplexer is the 2-to-1 multiplexer shown to  the right.   The logic diagram illustrates how the mux works.  The block  has two inputs from the left and one from the top.  The top input allows  us to choose which of the left inputs is forwarded to the output.   When the input S=0, the upper AND gate outputs 0, and the lower AND gate outputs the value of D_0.  The OR gate then produces Q=0+D_0=D_0. Similarly, when input S=1, the upper AND gate outputs D_1, and the lower AND gate outputs 0.  In this case, the OR gate produces Q=D_1+0=D_1.      The symbolic form of the mux is a trapezoid with data inputs on the  larger side, an output on the smaller side, and a select input on the angled part of the trapezoid.  The labels inside the trapezoid indicate  the value of the select input S for which the adjacent data signal,  D_1 or D_0, is copied to the output Q.  We can generalize multiplexers in two ways.  First, we can extend the  single select input to a group of select inputs.  An {N-bit} select input allows selection from amongst 2^N inputs.  A {4-to-1}  multiplexer is shown below, for example.  The logic diagram on the left shows how the {4-to-1 mux} operates.  For any combination of S_1S_0, three of the AND gates produce 0, and the fourth outputs the D input corresponding to the interpretation of S as an unsigned number. Given three zeroes and one D input, the OR gate thus reproduces one of  the D's.  When S_1S_0=10, for example, the third AND gate copies D_2, and Q=D_2.  {{file=part2/figs/mux4-to-1.eps,width=5.60in}}  As shown in the middle figure, a {4-to-1} mux can also be built from three {2-to-1} muxes.  Finally, the symbolic form of a {4-to-1} mux  appears on the right in the figure.    The second way in which we can generalize multiplexers is by using several multiplexers of the same type and using the same signals for  selection.  For example, we might use a single select bit T to choose  between any number of paired inputs.  Denote input pair by i D_1^i  and D_0^i.  For each pair, we have an output Q_i.    When T=0, Q_i=D_0^i for each value of i.  And, when T=1, Q_i=D_1^i for each value of i.  Each value of i requires a {2-to-1} mux with its select input driven by the global select signal T.  Returning to the example of the upper-",

Becoming a good engineer thus requires not only that you be able to solve problems creatively so as to improve the quality of your solutions, but also that you are aware of how people might evaluate those solutions and are able both to identify the most important metrics and to balance  your design effectively according to them.

Thus, once you have a set of metrics that you feel is complete,  your next step is to get rid of as many as you can.  Towards this end, you may identify metrics that have no practical  impact in current technology, set threshold values for other metrics to simplify reasoning about them, eliminate redundant metrics, calculate linear sums to reduce the count of metrics, and, finally, make use of the notion of Pareto optimality.  All of these ideas are described in the rest of this section.  Let's start by considering metrics that we can quantify as real numbers.  For a given metric, we can divide possible measurement values into three ranges.  In the first range, all measurement values are equivalently useful.

    "textbook-paragraph": "Notes Set 2.4, for example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares  two bits at a time.  In general, we can optimize logic for any  number of bits and then apply multiple copies of the resulting logic in space (a generalization of the bit-sliced approach), or in time (a generalization of the serialization approach), or in a combination of the two.  Sometimes these tradeoffs may happen at a higher level. As mentioned in Notes Set 2.3, computer software uses  the carry out of an adder to perform addition of larger  groups of bits (over multiple clock cycles) than is supported by the processor's adder hardware.  In computer system design, engineers often design hardware elements that are general enough to support this kind of extension in software.  As a concrete example of the possible tradeoffs, consider a serial comparator design based on the {2-bit} slice variant.  This approach leads to a serial design with 24 gates and 10 inverters,  which is not much larger than our earlier serial design.  In terms of gate delays, however, the new design is identical, meaning that we finish a comparison in half the time.  More realistic area and timing metrics show slightly more difference between the two designs.  These differences can  dominate the  results if we blindly scale the idea to handle more bits without  thinking carefully about the design.  Neither many-input gates nor gates driving many outputs work well in practice.    {Finite State Machines}  A { finite state machine} (or { FSM}) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a finite set of states, moving between these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs.  In any given state, a particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this  combination is called a { transition rule}.  An FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of  possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules, and methods for calculating outputs.    When an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be represented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must be translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.  For a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words, given any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits, a transition must be defined from that state to another state  (transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops},  are acceptable).  And, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces to Boolean logic expressions.  In this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations, in which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.  In this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and analyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next few weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control logic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections between FSMs and software and will make some connections with other areas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital  control systems.  The table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical  keyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the states rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each state---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states. The description of the states in the first column is an optional element often included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying the states needed for the design. A list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in the list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.  By including outputs for each state, we implicitly assume that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail later in these notes (see ``Machine Models''),  but will make the assumption throughout",

    "textbook-paragraph": "if a chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.  How do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only indirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make direct calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of logic expressions.    Finding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific logic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the  computational resources and algorithms available to us.  Instead, tools typically use heuristic approaches to find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics. A { heuristic} approach is one that is believed to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does not necessarily find an optimal solution.  A human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as limits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance, in order to guide the process.  Human engineers may also restructure the implementation of a  larger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic, so as to change the logic functions used in the design.  { Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of  optimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must supply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable  transformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt work of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is best to use in context.  Although we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no longer an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you should be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for such optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is  threefold.   First, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic logic reformulations (slowly is acceptable) and logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two  expressions represent the same function?'').  Second, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you to real engineering.  Finally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better understanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions that form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly by humans today.  Towards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two metrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize  logic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided  design} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies, but the reasons for their use are still interesting.  The first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for a design.  The measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in an expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see. Using our example function C,  Equation () gives a count of 6, Equation () gives a count of 8, and Equation () gives a count of 24. Smaller numbers represent better expressions, so  Equation () is the best choice by this metric.  Why is this metric interesting? Recall how gates are built from transistors. An {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you  count up the number of variables in the expression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed, which is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.  A variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations, since each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between gates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations, so a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts as 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation for this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes  available at no extra cost in gates or wires.  If we add the number of operations in our example, we get a count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs, and 6 variables,  a count of 12 for Equation ()---three",

      "answer": "\nThere are a few reasons why it is important to make implicit assumptions clear in the design process. First, if assumptions are not made clear, it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among the team members working on the design. Second, making assumptions explicit can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. Finally, explicit assumptions can help to prevent errors and mistakes in the design process."

    "textbook-paragraph": "Notes Set 2.4, for example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares  two bits at a time.  In general, we can optimize logic for any  number of bits and then apply multiple copies of the resulting logic in space (a generalization of the bit-sliced approach), or in time (a generalization of the serialization approach), or in a combination of the two.  Sometimes these tradeoffs may happen at a higher level. As mentioned in Notes Set 2.3, computer software uses  the carry out of an adder to perform addition of larger  groups of bits (over multiple clock cycles) than is supported by the processor's adder hardware.  In computer system design, engineers often design hardware elements that are general enough to support this kind of extension in software.  As a concrete example of the possible tradeoffs, consider a serial comparator design based on the {2-bit} slice variant.  This approach leads to a serial design with 24 gates and 10 inverters,  which is not much larger than our earlier serial design.  In terms of gate delays, however, the new design is identical, meaning that we finish a comparison in half the time.  More realistic area and timing metrics show slightly more difference between the two designs.  These differences can  dominate the  results if we blindly scale the idea to handle more bits without  thinking carefully about the design.  Neither many-input gates nor gates driving many outputs work well in practice.    {Finite State Machines}  A { finite state machine} (or { FSM}) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a finite set of states, moving between these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs.  In any given state, a particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this  combination is called a { transition rule}.  An FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of  possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules, and methods for calculating outputs.    When an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be represented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must be translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.  For a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words, given any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits, a transition must be defined from that state to another state  (transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops},  are acceptable).  And, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces to Boolean logic expressions.  In this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations, in which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.  In this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and analyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next few weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control logic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections between FSMs and software and will make some connections with other areas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital  control systems.  The table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical  keyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the states rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each state---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states. The description of the states in the first column is an optional element often included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying the states needed for the design. A list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in the list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.  By including outputs for each state, we implicitly assume that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail later in these notes (see ``Machine Models''),  but will make the assumption throughout",

Certainly Gray codes can be extended.  An { {N-bit} Gray code}  is a sequence of {N-bit} patterns that includes all possible patterns such that any two adjacent patterns differ in only one bit. The code is actually a cycle: the first and last patterns also differ in only one bit.  You can construct a Gray code recursively as follows: for an {(N+1)-bit} Gray code, write the sequence for an {N-bit} Gray code, then add a 0 in front of all patterns. After this sequence, append a second copy of the {N-bit} Gray code in reverse order, then put a 1 in front of all patterns in the second copy.  The result is an {(N+1)-bit} Gray code. For example, the following are Gray codes:   1-bit& 0, 1 2-bit& 00, 01, 11, 10 3-bit& 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100 4-bit&  0000, 0001, 0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 1101, 1111, 1110, 1010, 1011, 1001, 1000   Unfortunately, some of the beneficial properties of {K-maps} do not extend beyond two variables in a dimension.  { Once you have three variables in one dimension}, as is necessary if a function operates on five or more variables, { not all product terms are contiguous in the grid}.  The terms still require a total number of rows and columns equal to a power of two, but they don't all need to be a contiguous group.  Furthermore, { some contiguous groups of appropriate size do not correspond to product terms}.  So you can still make use of {K-maps} if you have more variables, but their use is a little trickier.  {Canonical Forms}  What if we want to compare two expressions to determine whether they represent the same logic function?  Such a comparison is a test of { logical equivalence}, and is an important part of hardware design. Tools today provide help with this problem, but you should understand the problem.  You know that any given function can be expressed in many ways, and that two expressions that look quite different may in fact represent the same function (look back at Equations () to () for an example).  But what if we rewrite the function using only  prime implicants?  Is the result unique?  Unfortunately, no.   In general, { a sum of products is not unique (nor is a product of sums), even if the sum contains only prime implicants}.  For example, consensus terms may or may not be included in our expressions.  (They are necessary for reliable design of  certain types of systems, as you will learn in a later ECE class.)  The green ellipse in the K-map to the right represents the consensus  term BC. {eqnarray*} Z &=& A C +  B + B C Z &=& A C +  B {eqnarray*}       Some functions allow several equivalent formulations as sums of prime implicants, even without consensus terms.   The K-maps shown to the right, for example, illustrate  how one function might be written in either of the following ways:  {eqnarray*} Z &=&   D +  C  + A B C + B  D Z &=&   C + B C  + A B D +   D {eqnarray*}         When we need to compare two things (such as functions), we need to transform them into what in mathematics is known as a { canonical form}, which simply means a form that is defined so as to be unique  for each thing of the given type. What can we use for logic functions?  You already know two answers!    The { canonical sum} of a function (sometimes called the { canonical SOP form}) is the sum of minterms.    The { canonical product} of a function (sometimes called the { canonical POS form}) is the product of maxterms.    These forms technically only meet the mathematical definition of canonical if we agree on an order for the min/maxterms, but that problem is solvable.  However, as you already know, the forms are not particularly  convenient to use.    In practice, people and tools in the industry use more",

There are too many factors involved to make direct calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of logic expressions.    Finding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific logic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the  computational resources and algorithms available to us.  Instead, tools typically use heuristic approaches to find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics. A { heuristic} approach is one that is believed to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does not necessarily find an optimal solution.  A human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as limits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance, in order to guide the process.

Finally, in Step {step-gates}, we translate our logic expressions into gates and use flip-flops (or registers) to hold the internal state bits of the FSM.  In later notes, we use more complex building blocks when implementing an FSM, building up abstractions in order to simplify the design process in much the same way that we have shown for combinational logic.   {Example: A Two-Bit Gray Code Counter}  Let's begin with a two-bit Gray code counter with no inputs. As we mentioned in Notes Set 2.1, a Gray code is a cycle over all bit patterns of a certain length in which consecutive patterns differ in exactly one bit.  For simplicity, our first few examples are based on counters and use the internal state of the FSM as the output values.  You should already know how to design combinational logic for the outputs if it were necessary.  The inputs to a counter, if any, are typically limited to functions such as starting and stopping the counter, controlling the counting  direction, and resetting the counter to a particular state.  A fully-specified transition diagram for  a two-bit Gray code counter appears below. With no inputs, the states simply form a loop, with the counter moving from one state to the next each cycle.  Each state in the diagram is marked with the internal state value S_1S_0  (before the ``/'') and the output Z_1Z_0 (after the ``/''), which are  always equal for this counter.  Based on the transition diagram, we can fill in the K-maps for the  next-state values S_1^+ and S_0^+ as shown to the right of the transition diagram, then  derive algebraic expressions in the usual way to obtain S_1^+=S_0 and S_0^+={{S_1}}.  We then use the next-state logic to develop the implementation shown on the far right, completing our first counter design.             {Example: A Three-Bit Gray Code Counter}   Now we'll add a third bit to our counter, but again use a Gray code as the basis for the state sequence.  A fully-specified transition diagram for such a counter appears to  the right.

This design does not allow much choice in developing good equations for the next-state logic, but some designs may enable you to reduce  the design complexity by explicitly identifying and making use of  common algebraic terms and sub-expressions for different outputs. In modern design processes, identifying such opportunities is generally performed by a computer program, but it's important to understand how they arise.  Note that the common term becomes a single AND gate in the implementation of our counter, as shown to the right.

For safety reasons, the controller must ensure that the lights on one or both roads are red at all times.    Similarly, if a road has a green light, the controller should  show a yellow light before showing a red light to give drivers some warning and allow them to slow down.  Finally, for fairness, the controller should alternate green lights between the two roads.  Now take a look at the logic diagram below.  The state of the FSM has been split into two pieces: a {3-bit}  register S and a {6-bit} timer.  The timer is simply a binary  counter that counts downward and produces an output of Z=1 when it  reaches 0.  Notice that the register S only takes a new value when the timer reaches 0, and that the Z signal from the timer also forces a new value to be loaded into the timer in the next  cycle.  We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by  cycle basis as consisting of two types.  The first type simply counts downward for a number of cycles while holding the register S constant, while the second changes the value of S and sets the timer in order to maintain the new value of S  for some number of cycles.    3.45   Let's look at the next-state logic for S, which feeds into the IN inputs on the {3-bit} register (S_2^+=IN_2 and so forth).  Notice  that none of the inputs to the FSM directly affect these values.  The states of S thus act like a counter.  By examining the connections, we can derive equations for the next state and draw a transition diagram, as shown to the right.  As the figure shows, there are six states in the loop defined by the  next-state logic, with the two remaining states converging into the loop after a single cycle.  Let's now examine the outputs for each state in order to understand how the stoplight sequencing works.  We derive equations for the outputs that control the lights, as shown to the right, then calculate values and colors for each state, as shown to the far right.  For completeness, the table  includes the states outside of the desired loop.  The  lights are all red in both of these states, which is necessary for safety.   {eqnarray*}  S_2^+ &=& {S_2} + S_0 S_1^+ &=& {S_2}  S_1 S_0^+ &=& {S_2} {eqnarray*}  {eqnarray*} L_1^ &=& S_2 S_1 L_0^ &=& S_0 L_1^ &=& S_2 {S_1} L_0^ &=& S_0 {eqnarray*}    {c|cc|cc} &&& EW& NS &&& light& light S& L^& L^& color& color  000& 00& 00&    red&    red 111& 11& 01&  green&    red 110& 10& 00& yellow&    red 010& 00& 00&    red&    red 101& 01& 11&    red&  green 100& 00& 10&    red& yellow  001& 01& 01&    red&    red 011& 01& 01&    red&    red     Now let's think about how the timer works.  As we already noted, the timer value is set whenever S enters a new state, but it can also be set under other conditions---in particular, by the signal F calculated at the bottom of the FSM logic diagram.     For now, assume that F=0.  In this case, the timer is set only when the state S changes, and we can find the duration of each state by analyzing the muxes.  The bottom mux selects A when S_2=0, and  selects the output of the top mux when S_2=1.  The top mux selects B when S_0=1, and selects C when S_0=0.  Combining these results, we can calculate the duration of the next states of S when F=0,  as shown in the table to the right.  We can then combine the next state duration with our previous calculation of the state sequencing  (also the order in the table) to obtain the durations of each state, also shown in the rightmost column of the table.   {c|cc|cc} & EW& NS& next& current & light& light& state& state S& color& color& duration& duration  000&    red&    red& A& C 111&  green&    red& B& A 110& yellow&    red& C& B 010&    red&    red& A& C 101&    red&  green& B& A 100&    red& yellow& C& B  001&    red&    red& A& --- 011&    red&    red& A& ---    What does F do?

Finally, in Step {step-gates}, we translate our logic expressions into gates and use flip-flops (or registers) to hold the internal state bits of the FSM.  In later notes, we use more complex building blocks when implementing an FSM, building up abstractions in order to simplify the design process in much the same way that we have shown for combinational logic.   {Example: A Two-Bit Gray Code Counter}  Let's begin with a two-bit Gray code counter with no inputs. As we mentioned in Notes Set 2.1, a Gray code is a cycle over all bit patterns of a certain length in which consecutive patterns differ in exactly one bit.  For simplicity, our first few examples are based on counters and use the internal state of the FSM as the output values.  You should already know how to design combinational logic for the outputs if it were necessary.  The inputs to a counter, if any, are typically limited to functions such as starting and stopping the counter, controlling the counting  direction, and resetting the counter to a particular state.  A fully-specified transition diagram for  a two-bit Gray code counter appears below. With no inputs, the states simply form a loop, with the counter moving from one state to the next each cycle.  Each state in the diagram is marked with the internal state value S_1S_0  (before the ``/'') and the output Z_1Z_0 (after the ``/''), which are  always equal for this counter.  Based on the transition diagram, we can fill in the K-maps for the  next-state values S_1^+ and S_0^+ as shown to the right of the transition diagram, then  derive algebraic expressions in the usual way to obtain S_1^+=S_0 and S_0^+={{S_1}}.  We then use the next-state logic to develop the implementation shown on the far right, completing our first counter design.             {Example: A Three-Bit Gray Code Counter}   Now we'll add a third bit to our counter, but again use a Gray code as the basis for the state sequence.  A fully-specified transition diagram for such a counter appears to  the right.  As before, with no inputs, the states simply form a loop,  with the counter moving from one state to the next each cycle.  Each state in the diagram is marked with the internal state value S_2S_1S_0  (before ``/'') and the output Z_2Z_1Z_0 (after ``/'').        Based on the transition diagram, we can fill in the K-maps for the  next-state values S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+ as shown to the right, then  derive algebraic expressions.  The results are more complex this  time.          For our next-state logic, we obtain: {eqnarray*} S_2^+ &=& S_2 S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}}  S_1^+ &=& {{S_2}} S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}}  S_0^+ &=& {{S_2}} {{S_1}} + S_2 S_1 {eqnarray*}   Notice that the equations for S_2^+ and S_1^+ share a common term, S_1{{S_0}}.  This design does not allow much choice in developing good equations for the next-state logic, but some designs may enable you to reduce  the design complexity by explicitly identifying and making use of  common algebraic terms and sub-expressions for different outputs. In modern design processes, identifying such opportunities is generally performed by a computer program, but it's important to understand how they arise.  Note that the common term becomes a single AND gate in the implementation of our counter, as shown to the right.  Looking at the counter's implementation diagram, notice that the vertical lines carrying the current state values and their inverses back to the next state logic inputs have been carefully ordered to simplify understanding the diagram.  In particular, they are ordered from left to right (on the left side of the figure) as  {{S_0}}S_0{{S_1}}S_1{{S_2}}S_2. When designing any logic diagram, be sure to make use of a reasonable order so as to make it easy for someone (including yourself!) to read  and check the correctness of the logic.       {Example: A Color Sequencer}   Early graphics systems",

    "textbook-paragraph": "if a chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.  How do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only indirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make direct calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of logic expressions.    Finding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific logic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the  computational resources and algorithms available to us.  Instead, tools typically use heuristic approaches to find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics. A { heuristic} approach is one that is believed to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does not necessarily find an optimal solution.  A human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as limits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance, in order to guide the process.  Human engineers may also restructure the implementation of a  larger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic, so as to change the logic functions used in the design.  { Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of  optimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must supply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable  transformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt work of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is best to use in context.  Although we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no longer an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you should be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for such optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is  threefold.   First, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic logic reformulations (slowly is acceptable) and logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two  expressions represent the same function?'').  Second, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you to real engineering.  Finally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better understanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions that form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly by humans today.  Towards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two metrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize  logic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided  design} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies, but the reasons for their use are still interesting.  The first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for a design.  The measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in an expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see. Using our example function C,  Equation () gives a count of 6, Equation () gives a count of 8, and Equation () gives a count of 24. Smaller numbers represent better expressions, so  Equation () is the best choice by this metric.  Why is this metric interesting? Recall how gates are built from transistors. An {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you  count up the number of variables in the expression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed, which is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.  A variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations, since each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between gates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations, so a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts as 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation for this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes  available at no extra cost in gates or wires.  If we add the number of operations in our example, we get a count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs, and 6 variables,  a count of 12 for Equation ()---three",

For our next-state logic, we obtain: {eqnarray*} S_2^+ &=& S_2 S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}}  S_1^+ &=& {{S_2}} S_0 + S_1 {{S_0}}  S_0^+ &=& {{S_2}} {{S_1}} + S_2 S_1 {eqnarray*}   Notice that the equations for S_2^+ and S_1^+ share a common term, S_1{{S_0}}.  This design does not allow much choice in developing good equations for the next-state logic, but some designs may enable you to reduce  the design complexity by explicitly identifying and making use of  common algebraic terms and sub-expressions for different outputs. In modern design processes, identifying such opportunities is generally performed by a computer program, but it's important to understand how they arise.  Note that the common term becomes a single AND gate in the implementation of our counter, as shown to the right.  Looking at the counter's implementation diagram, notice that the vertical lines carrying the current state values and their inverses back to the next state logic inputs have been carefully ordered to simplify understanding the diagram.  In particular, they are ordered from left to right (on the left side of the figure) as  {{S_0}}S_0{{S_1}}S_1{{S_2}}S_2. When designing any logic diagram, be sure to make use of a reasonable order so as to make it easy for someone (including yourself!) to read  and check the correctness of the logic.       {Example: A Color Sequencer}   Early graphics systems",

We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by  cycle basis as consisting of two types.

Finally, in Step {step-gates}, we translate our logic expressions into gates and use flip-flops (or registers) to hold the internal state bits of the FSM.  In later notes, we use more complex building blocks when implementing an FSM, building up abstractions in order to simplify the design process in much the same way that we have shown for combinational logic.   {Example: A Two-Bit Gray Code Counter}  Let's begin with a two-bit Gray code counter with no inputs. As we mentioned in Notes Set 2.1, a Gray code is a cycle over all bit patterns of a certain length in which consecutive patterns differ in exactly one bit.  For simplicity, our first few examples are based on counters and use the internal state of the FSM as the output values.  You should already know how to design combinational logic for the outputs if it were necessary.  The inputs to a counter, if any, are typically limited to functions such as starting and stopping the counter, controlling the counting  direction, and resetting the counter to a particular state.

Imagine that you are charged with creating a counter to drive a light through a sequence of colors.  The light takes an RGB input as just described, and the desired pattern is  {off (black)     yellow     violet     green     blue}  You immediately recognize that you merely need a counter with five states.  How many flip-flops will we need?  At least three, since _2 (5)=3.  Given that we need three flip-flops,  and that the colors we need to produce as   {c|l} RGB& color  000& black 001& blue 010& green 011& cyan 100& red 101& violet 110& yellow 111& white    outputs are all unique bit patterns, we can again choose to use the counter's internal  state directly as our output values.   A fully-specified transition diagram for our color sequencer appears to the right.  The states again form a loop, and are marked with the internal state value S_2S_1S_0  and the output RGB.       As before, we can use the transition diagram to fill in K-maps for the  next-state values S_2^+, S_1^+, and S_0^+, as shown to the right. For each of the three states not included in our transition diagram, we have inserted x's          into the K-maps to indicate ``don't care.''  As you know, we can treat each x as either a 0 or a 1, whichever produces better results (where ``better'' usually means simpler  equations).  The terms that we have chosen for our algebraic  equations are illustrated in the K-maps.  The x's within the ellipses become 1s in the implementation, and the x's outside of the ellipses become 0s.   For our next-state logic, we obtain: {eqnarray*} S_2^+ &=& S_2 S_1 + {{S_1}} {{S_0}}  S_1^+ &=& S_2 S_0 + {{S_1}} {{S_0}}  S_0^+ &=& S_1 {eqnarray*}  Again our equations for S_2^+ and S_1^+ share a common term, which becomes a single AND gate in the implementation shown to the right.      {Identifying an Initial State}  Let's say that you go the lab and build the implementation above,  hook it up to the light, and turn it on.  Does it work?  Sometimes. Sometimes it works perfectly, but sometimes the light glows cyan or red briefly first. At other times, the light is an unchanging white.   What could be going wrong?  Let's try to understand.  We begin by deriving K-maps for the implementation, as shown to the right.  In these K-maps, each of the x's in our design has been replaced by either a 0 or a 1.  These entries are highlighted with green italics.   {file=part3/figs/colS2-bad.eps,width=1.00in}  {file=part3/figs/colS1-bad.eps,width=1.00in}  {file=part3/figs/colS0-bad.eps,width=1.00in}   Now let's imagine what might happen if somehow our FSM got into the S_2S_1S_0=111 state.  In such a state, the light would appear white, since RGB=S_2S_1S_0=111.  What happens in the next cycle?  Plugging into the equations or looking into the K-maps gives (of course) the same answer: the next state is the S_2^+S_1^+S_0^+=111 state. In other words, the light stays white indefinitely!  As an exercise, you should check what happens  if the light is red or cyan.  We can extend the transition diagram that we developed for our design with the extra states possible in the implementation, as shown below. As with the five states in the design, the extra states are named with the color of light that they produce.  {{file=part3/figs/colors-full.eps,width=5.8in}}  Notice that the FSM does not move out of the WHITE state (ever).    You may at this point wonder whether more careful decisions  in selecting our next-state expressions might address this issue. To some extent, yes.  For example, if we replace the  S_2S_1 term in the equation for S_2^+ with S_2{{S_0}},  a decision allowed by the ``don't care'' boxes in the K-map for our design, the resulting transition diagram does not suffer from the problem that we've found.  However, even if we do change our implementation slightly, we need to address another aspect of the problem:  how can the FSM",

    "textbook-paragraph": "have other names for the smaller values: a point for N=0, a line segment for N=1, a square for N=2, and a cube for N=3.  The diagrams above and to the right illustrate the cases that  are easily drawn on paper.  The black dots represent specific input combinations, and the blue edges connect input combinations that differ in exactly one input value (one bit).    By viewing a function's domain in this way, we can make a connection between a product of literals and the structure of the domain.  Let's use the {3-dimensional} version as an example.  We call the  variables A, B, and C, and note that the cube has 2^3=8 corners corresponding to the 2^3 possible combinations of A, B, and C. The simplest product of literals in this case is 1, which is the product of 0 literals.  Obviously, the product 1  evaluates to 1 for any variable values.  We can thus think of it as covering the entire domain of the function.  In the case of our example, the product 1 covers the whole cube.  In order for the product 1 to  be an implicant of a function, the function itself must be the function 1.  What about a product consisting of a single literal, such as A  or ?  The dividing lines in the diagram illustrate the answer: any such product term evaluates to 1 on a face of the cube, which includes 2^2=4 of the corners.  If a function evaluates to 1 on any of the six faces of the cube, the corresponding product term (consisting of a single literal) is an implicant of the function.  Continuing with products of two literals, we see that any product of  two literals, such as A or C, corresponds to an edge of our {3-dimensional} cube.  The edge includes 2^1=2 corners.  And, if a function evaluates to 1 on any of the 12 edges of the cube, the corresponding product term (consisting of two literals) is an implicant of the function.  Finally, any product of three literals, such as B, corresponds to a corner of the cube.  But for a function on three variables, these are just the minterms.  As you know, if a function evaluates to 1 on any of the 8 corners of the cube, that minterm is an implicant of the function (we used this idea to construct the function to prove logical completeness).  How do these connections help us to simplify functions?  If we're careful, we can map cubes onto paper in such a way that product terms (the possible implicants of the function) usually form contiguous  groups of 1s, allowing us to spot them easily.  Let's work upwards starting from one variable to see how this idea works.  The end result is called a Karnaugh map.   The first drawing shown to the right replicates our view of  the {1-dimensional} hypercube, corresponding to the domain of a function on one variable, in this case the variable A.   To the right of the hypercube (line segment) are two variants of a Karnaugh map on one variable.  The middle variant clearly  indicates the column corresponding to the product A (the other  column corresponds to ).  The right variant simply labels the column with values for A.       The three drawings shown to the right illustrate the three possible product terms on one variable.  { The functions shown in  these Karnaugh maps are arbitrary, except that we have chosen them such that each implicant shown is a prime implicant for the illustrated function.}        Let's now look at two-variable functions.  We have replicated our drawing of the {2-dimensional} hypercube (square) to the right  along with two variants of Karnaugh maps on two variables. With only two variables (A and B), the extension is fairly  straightforward, since we can use the second dimension of the  paper (vertical) to express the second variable (B).       The number of possible products of literals grows rapidly with the  number of variables. For two variables, nine are possible, as shown to the right. Notice that all implicants have two properties.  First, they occupy contiguous regions of the grid.  And, second, their height and width are always powers of two.",

    "textbook-paragraph": "if a chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.  How do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only indirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make direct calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of logic expressions.    Finding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific logic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the  computational resources and algorithms available to us.  Instead, tools typically use heuristic approaches to find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics. A { heuristic} approach is one that is believed to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does not necessarily find an optimal solution.  A human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as limits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance, in order to guide the process.  Human engineers may also restructure the implementation of a  larger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic, so as to change the logic functions used in the design.  { Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of  optimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must supply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable  transformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt work of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is best to use in context.  Although we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no longer an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you should be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for such optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is  threefold.   First, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic logic reformulations (slowly is acceptable) and logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two  expressions represent the same function?'').  Second, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you to real engineering.  Finally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better understanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions that form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly by humans today.  Towards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two metrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize  logic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided  design} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies, but the reasons for their use are still interesting.  The first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for a design.  The measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in an expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see. Using our example function C,  Equation () gives a count of 6, Equation () gives a count of 8, and Equation () gives a count of 24. Smaller numbers represent better expressions, so  Equation () is the best choice by this metric.  Why is this metric interesting? Recall how gates are built from transistors. An {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you  count up the number of variables in the expression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed, which is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.  A variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations, since each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between gates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations, so a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts as 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation for this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes  available at no extra cost in gates or wires.  If we add the number of operations in our example, we get a count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs, and 6 variables,  a count of 12 for Equation ()---three",

For safety reasons, the controller must ensure that the lights on one or both roads are red at all times.    Similarly, if a road has a green light, the controller should  show a yellow light before showing a red light to give drivers some warning and allow them to slow down.  Finally, for fairness, the controller should alternate green lights between the two roads.  Now take a look at the logic diagram below.  The state of the FSM has been split into two pieces: a {3-bit}  register S and a {6-bit} timer.  The timer is simply a binary  counter that counts downward and produces an output of Z=1 when it  reaches 0.  Notice that the register S only takes a new value when the timer reaches 0, and that the Z signal from the timer also forces a new value to be loaded into the timer in the next  cycle.  We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by  cycle basis as consisting of two types.  The first type simply counts downward for a number of cycles while holding the register S constant, while the second changes the value of S and sets the timer in order to maintain the new value of S  for some number of cycles.    3.45   Let's look at the next-state logic for S, which feeds into the IN inputs on the {3-bit} register (S_2^+=IN_2 and so forth).  Notice  that none of the inputs to the FSM directly affect these values.  The states of S thus act like a counter.  By examining the connections, we can derive equations for the next state and draw a transition diagram, as shown to the right.  As the figure shows, there are six states in the loop defined by the  next-state logic, with the two remaining states converging into the loop after a single cycle.  Let's now examine the outputs for each state in order to understand how the stoplight sequencing works.  We derive equations for the outputs that control the lights, as shown to the right, then calculate values and colors for each state, as shown to the far right.  For completeness, the table  includes the states outside of the desired loop.  The  lights are all red in both of these states, which is necessary for safety.   {eqnarray*}  S_2^+ &=& {S_2} + S_0 S_1^+ &=& {S_2}  S_1 S_0^+ &=& {S_2} {eqnarray*}  {eqnarray*} L_1^ &=& S_2 S_1 L_0^ &=& S_0 L_1^ &=& S_2 {S_1} L_0^ &=& S_0 {eqnarray*}    {c|cc|cc} &&& EW& NS &&& light& light S& L^& L^& color& color  000& 00& 00&    red&    red 111& 11& 01&  green&    red 110& 10& 00& yellow&    red 010& 00& 00&    red&    red 101& 01& 11&    red&  green 100& 00& 10&    red& yellow  001& 01& 01&    red&    red 011& 01& 01&    red&    red     Now let's think about how the timer works.  As we already noted, the timer value is set whenever S enters a new state, but it can also be set under other conditions---in particular, by the signal F calculated at the bottom of the FSM logic diagram.     For now, assume that F=0.  In this case, the timer is set only when the state S changes, and we can find the duration of each state by analyzing the muxes.  The bottom mux selects A when S_2=0, and  selects the output of the top mux when S_2=1.  The top mux selects B when S_0=1, and selects C when S_0=0.  Combining these results, we can calculate the duration of the next states of S when F=0,  as shown in the table to the right.  We can then combine the next state duration with our previous calculation of the state sequencing  (also the order in the table) to obtain the durations of each state, also shown in the rightmost column of the table.   {c|cc|cc} & EW& NS& next& current & light& light& state& state S& color& color& duration& duration  000&    red&    red& A& C 111&  green&    red& B& A 110& yellow&    red& C& B 010&    red&    red& A& C 101&    red&  green& B& A 100&    red& yellow& C& B  001&    red&    red& A& --- 011&    red&    red& A& ---    What does F do?

    "textbook-paragraph": "written ``hi-Z'').  In other words, there is effectively no electrical connection between the tri-state  buffer and the output OUT.  This logical disconnection is achieved by using the outer   {file=part3/figs/tri-state.eps,width=3in}   {cc|c} EN& IN& OUT  0& x& Z 1& 0& 0 1& 1& 1    (upper and lower) pair of transistors in the logic diagram.  When EN=0, both transistors turn off, meaning that regardless of the value of IN, OUT is connected neither to high voltage nor to ground.  When EN=1, both transistors turn on, and the tri-state buffer acts as a pair of back-to-back inverters, copying the signal from IN to OUT, as shown in the truth table.  What benefit does this logical disconnection provide?  So long as only one memory's chip select input is high at any time, the same output line can be shared by more than one memory without the need for additional multiplexers.  Memory chips were often combined in this way to produce larger memories.   The figure to the right illustrates how larger memories can be constructed using multiple chips.  In the case shown, two {2^-bit}  memories are used to implement a {2^{k+1}-bit} memory. One of the address bits---in the case shown, the most significant bit---is used to drive a decoder that determines which of the two chips is  active (CS=1).  The decoder is enabled with the chip select signal for the larger memory, so neither chip is enabled when the external CS is low, as desired.  The   {file=part3/figs/mem-larger.eps,width=4.75in}   rest of the address bits, as well as the external data inputs and write enable signal, are simply delivered to both memories. The external data outputs are also connected to both memories.   Ensuring that at most one chip select signal is high at any time guarantees that at most one of the two memory chips drives logic values on the data outputs.   Multiple chips can also be used to construct wider memories, as shown to the right.  In the case shown, two {2^-bit}  memories are used to implement a {2^-bit} memory. Both chips are either active or inactive at the same time, so the external  address, write enable, and chip select inputs are routed to both chips. In contrast, the data inputs and outputs are separate: the left chip handles the high N bits of input on writes and produces the high N bits of output on reads, while the right chip handles the low N bits of  input and produces the low N bits of output.   {file=part3/figs/mem-wider.eps,width=4.05in}   Historically, tri-state buffers were also used to reduce the number of pins needed on chips.  Pins have long been a scarce resource, and the  amount of data that can cross a chip's pins in a second (the product of the number of pins and the data rate per pin) has not grown nearly as rapidly  as the number of transistors packed into a fixed area.  By combining inputs and outputs, chip designers were able to halve the number of pins needed.  For example, data inputs and outputs of memory were often combined into a single set of data wires, with bidirectional signals.  When performing a read from a memory chip, the memory chip drove the data pins with the bits being read (tri-state buffers on the memory chip were enabled).  When performing a write, other logic such as  a processor wrote the value to be stored onto the data pins (tri-state  buffers were not enabled).   {Dynamic Random Access Memory*}  Dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, is used for main memory in computers and for other applications in which size is more important than speed.  While slower than SRAM, DRAM is denser (has more bits per chip area).  A substantial part of DRAM density is due to transistor count: typical SRAM cells use six transistors (two for each inverter, and two more to connect the inverters to the  bit lines), while DRAM cells use only a single transistor. However, memory designers have also made significant advances in further miniaturizing DRAM cells to improve density beyond the  benefit available from simple transistor",

    "textbook-paragraph": "range corresponds to systems in which when a processor's power consumption in a digital  system is extremely low relative to the power consumption of the system. For example, the processor in a computer might use less than 1  of the total used by  the system including the disk drive, the monitor, the power  supply, and so forth.  One power consumption value in this range  is just as good as any another, and no one cares about the power consumption of the processor  in such cases.  In the second range, power consumption of the processor makes a difference.  Cell phones use most of their energy in radio operation, for example, but if you own a phone with a powerful processor, you may have noticed that you can turn off the phone and  drain the battery fairly quickly by playing a game.  Designing a processor that uses half as much power lengthens the battery life in such cases.  Finally, the third region of power consumption measurements is impossible: if you use so much power, your chip will overheat or even burst into flames.  Consumers get unhappy when such things happen.  As a first step, you can remove any metrics for which all solutions are effectively equivalent.  Until a little less than a decade ago, for example, the power  consumption of a desktop processor actually was in the first range that we discussed.  Power was simply not a concern to engineers: all designs of  interest consumed so little power that no one cared.  Unfortunately, at that point, power consumption jumped into the third range rather quickly.  Processors hit a wall, and  products had to be cancelled.  Given that the time spent designing a processor has historically been about five years, a lot of engineering effort was wasted because people had not thought carefully enough about power (since it had never mattered in the past).  Today, power is an important metric that engineers must take into account in their designs.   However, in some areas, such as desktop and high-end server processors, other metrics (such as performance) may be so  important that we always want to operate at the edge of the interesting range.  In such cases, we might choose to treat  a metric such as power consumption as a { threshold}: stay below 150 Watts for a desktop processor, for example.  One still has to make a coordinated effort to ensure that the system as a whole does not exceed the threshold, but reasoning about  threshold values, a form of constraint, is easier than trying to think about multiple metrics at once.  Some metrics may only allow discrete quantification.  For example, one could choose to define compatibility with previous processor generations as binary: either an existing piece of software (or operating system) runs out of the box on your new processor, or it does not.  If you  want people who own that software to make use of your new processor, you must ensure that the value of this binary metric is 1, which can also be viewed as a threshold.  In some cases, two metrics may be strongly { correlated}, meaning that a design that is good for one of the metrics is frequently  good for the other metric as well.  Chip area and cost, for example, are technically distinct ways to measure a digital design, but we rarely consider them separately.  A design that requires a larger chip is probably more complex, and thus takes more engineering time to get right (engineering time costs money).    Each silicon wafer costs money to fabricate, and fewer copies of a  large design fit on one wafer, so large chips mean more fabrication cost.  Physical defects in silicon can cause some chips not to work.  A large chip uses more silicon than a small one, and is thus more likely to suffer from defects (and not work).  Cost thus goes up again for large chips relative to small ones.  Finally, large chips usually require more careful testing to ensure that they work properly (even ignoring the cost of getting the design right, we have to test for the presence of defects), which",

Furthermore, { some contiguous groups of appropriate size do not correspond to product terms}.

Such a comparison is a test of { logical equivalence}, and is an important part of hardware design. Tools today provide help with this problem, but you should understand the problem.  You know that any given function can be expressed in many ways, and that two expressions that look quite different may in fact represent the same function (look back at Equations () to () for an example).  But what if we rewrite the function using only  prime implicants?  Is the result unique?  Unfortunately, no.   In general, { a sum of products is not unique (nor is a product of sums), even if the sum contains only prime implicants}.  For example, consensus terms may or may not be included in our expressions.  (They are necessary for reliable design of  certain types of systems, as you will learn in a later ECE class.)  The green ellipse in the K-map to the right represents the consensus  term BC. {eqnarray*} Z &=& A C +  B + B C Z &=& A C +  B {eqnarray*}       Some functions allow several equivalent formulations as sums of prime implicants, even without consensus terms.

For safety reasons, the controller must ensure that the lights on one or both roads are red at all times.    Similarly, if a road has a green light, the controller should  show a yellow light before showing a red light to give drivers some warning and allow them to slow down.  Finally, for fairness, the controller should alternate green lights between the two roads.  Now take a look at the logic diagram below.  The state of the FSM has been split into two pieces: a {3-bit}  register S and a {6-bit} timer.  The timer is simply a binary  counter that counts downward and produces an output of Z=1 when it  reaches 0.  Notice that the register S only takes a new value when the timer reaches 0, and that the Z signal from the timer also forces a new value to be loaded into the timer in the next  cycle.  We can thus think of transitions in the FSM on a cycle by  cycle basis as consisting of two types.  The first type simply counts downward for a number of cycles while holding the register S constant, while the second changes the value of S and sets the timer in order to maintain the new value of S  for some number of cycles.    3.45   Let's look at the next-state logic for S, which feeds into the IN inputs on the {3-bit} register (S_2^+=IN_2 and so forth).  Notice  that none of the inputs to the FSM directly affect these values.  The states of S thus act like a counter.  By examining the connections, we can derive equations for the next state and draw a transition diagram, as shown to the right.  As the figure shows, there are six states in the loop defined by the  next-state logic, with the two remaining states converging into the loop after a single cycle.  Let's now examine the outputs for each state in order to understand how the stoplight sequencing works.

The procedure is called with the constants 10, 20, and 30, and the result is printed.  By the calling convention, when the call is made, R0 must contain the value 10, R1 the value 20, and R2 the value 30.  We assume that the caller wants to preserve the value of R1, but does not care about R3 or R5.  In the assembly language version on the right, R1 is first saved to the stack, then the arguments are marshaled into position, and finally the call is made.  The procedure itself needs no local storage and does not change any callee-saved registers, thus must simply add the numbers together and place the result in R6.  After add3 returns, its return value is moved from R6 to R1 in preparation for the call to printf.  After loading a pointer to the format string into R0, the second call is made, and R1 is restored, completing the translation.  { System calls} are almost identical to procedure calls.  As with procedure calls, a calling convention is used: before invoking a system call, arguments are marshaled into the appropriate registers or locations in the stack; after a system call returns, any result appears in a pre-specified register.  The calling convention used for system calls need not be the same as that used for procedure calls. Rather than a call instruction, system calls are usually initiated with a { trap} instruction, and system calls are also known as traps.  With many architectures, a system call places the processor in privileged or kernel mode, and the instructions that implement the call are considered to be part of the operating system.  The term system call arises from this fact.      {Interrupts and Exceptions*}  Unexpected processor interruptions arise both from interactions between a processor and external devices and from errors or unexpected behavior in the program being executed.  The term { interrupt} is reserved for asynchronous interruptions generated by other devices, including disk drives, printers, network cards, video cards, keyboards, mice, and any number of other possibilities.  { Exceptions} occur when a processor encounters an unexpected opcode or operand.  An undefined instruction, for example, gives rise to an exception, as does an attempt to divide by zero.  Exceptions usually cause the current program to terminate, although many operating systems will allow the program to catch the exception and to handle it more intelligently.  The table below summarizes the characteristics of the two types and compares them to system calls.  { {|l|l|l|c|c|} {|c|}& {c|}{generated by}& {c|}& asynchronous& unexpected  interrupt& external device& packet arrived at network card& yes& yes exception& invalid opcode or operand& divide by zero& no& yes trap/system call& deliberate, via trap instruction& print character to console& no& no   }  Interrupts occur asynchronously with respect to the program.  Most designs only recognize interrupts between instructions.  In other words,  the presence of interrupts is checked only after completing an instruction rather than in every cycle.  In pipelined designs, however, instructions execute simultaneously, and the decision as to which instructions occur ``before'' an interrupt and which occur ``after'' must be made by the processor.  Exceptions are not asynchronous in the sense that they occur",

As a concrete example, let's design logic to control an ice cream  dispenser.  The dispenser has two flavors, lychee and mango, but also allows us to create a blend of the two flavors. For each of the two flavors, our logic must output two bits to control the amount of ice cream that comes out of the dispenser. The two-bit C_L[1:0] output of our logic must specify the number  of half-servings of lychee ice cream as a binary number, and the two-bit C_M[1:0] output must specify the number of  half-servings of mango ice cream.  Thus, for either flavor, 00 indicates none of that flavor, 01 indicates one-half of a serving, and  10 indicates a full serving.  Inputs to our logic will consist of three buttons: an L button to request a serving of lychee ice cream, a B button to request a blend---half a serving of each flavor, and an M button to request a serving of mango ice cream.

In this case, we can treat input combinations in which more than one button is pressed as ``don't care'' values in the truth tables for the outputs.  K-maps for all four output bits appear below. The x's indicate ``don't care'' values.    When we calculate the logic function for an output, each ``don't care'' value can be treated as either 0 or 1, whichever is more convenient in terms of creating the logic.  In the case of C_M[1], for  example, we can treat the three x's in the ellipse as 1s, treat the x outside of the ellipse as a 0, and simply use M (the implicant represented by the ellipse) for C_M[1].  The other three output bits are left as an exercise, although the result  appears momentarily.   The implementation at right takes full advantage of the ``don't care'' parts of our specification.  In this case, we require no logic at all; we need merely connect the inputs to the correct outputs.  Let's verify the operation.  We have four cases to consider.  First, if none of the  buttons are pushed (LBM=000), we get no ice cream, as desired (C_M=00  and C_L=00).  Second, if we request lychee ice cream (LBM=100), the outputs are C_L=10 and C_M=00, so we get a full serving of lychee and no mango.  Third, if we request a blend (LBM=010), the outputs are C_L=01 and C_M=01, giving us half a serving of each flavor. Finally, if we request mango ice cream (LBM=001), we get no lychee but a full serving of mango.      The K-maps for this implementation appear below.  Each of the ``don't care'' x's from the original design has been replaced with either a 0 or a 1 and highlighted with shading and green italics. Any implementation produces  either 0 or 1 for every output bit for every possible input combination.  {{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}}  As you can see, leveraging ``don't care'' output bits can sometimes significantly simplify our logic.  In the case of this example, we were able to completely eliminate any need for gates!  Unfortunately,  the resulting implementation may sometimes produce unexpected results.   Based on the implementation, what happens if a user presses more than one button?  The ice cream cup overflows!  Let's see why.  Consider the case LBM=101, in which we've pressed both the lychee and mango buttons.  Here C_L=10 and C_M=10, so our dispenser releases a  full serving of each flavor, or two servings total.  Pressing other  combinations may have other repercussions as well. Consider pressing lychee and blend (LBM=110).  The outputs are then C_L=11 and C_M=01.

    "textbook-paragraph": "ever get into the unexpected states?   What is the initial state of the three flip-flops in our implementation?  { The initial state may not even be 0s and 1s unless we have an  explicit mechanism for initialization.}   Initialization can work in two ways.    The first approach makes use of the flip-flop design. As you know, a flip-flop is built from a pair of latches, and we can  make use of the internal reset lines on these latches to force each flip-flop into the 0 state (or the 1 state) using an additional input.   Alternatively, we can add some extra logic to our design.  Consider adding a few AND gates and a  input (active low), as shown in the dashed box in the figure to the right. In this case, when we assert  by setting it to 0, the FSM moves to state 000 in the next cycle, putting it into the BLACK state.  The approach taken here is for clarity; one can optimize the design, if desired.  For example, we could simply connect  as an extra input into the three AND gates on the left rather than adding new ones, with the same effect.  We may sometimes want a more powerful initialization mechanism---one that allows us to force the FSM into any specific state in the next cycle.  In such a case, we can add multiplexers to each of our  flip-flop inputs, allowing us to use the INIT input to choose between normal operation (INIT=0) of the FSM and forcing the FSM into the next state given by I_2I_1I_0 (when INIT=1).         {Developing an Abstract Model}   We are now ready to discuss the design process for an FSM from start to finish.  For this first abstract FSM example, we build upon something that we have already seen: a two-bit Gray code counter. We now want a counter that allows us to start and stop the   {c|ccc} state&    no input&  halt button& go button  counting& counting&      halted&  halted&   halted&              & counting    count.  What is the mechanism for stopping and starting?  To begin our design, we could sketch out an abstract next-state table such as the one shown to the right above.  In this form of the table, the first column lists the states, while each of the other columns lists states to which the FSM transitions after a clock cycle for a particular input combination.   The table contains two states, counting and halted, and specifies that the design uses two distinct buttons to move between the states. The table further implies that if the counter is halted, the ``halt'' button has no additional effect, and if the counter is counting, the ``go'' button has no additional effect.   A counter with a single counting state, of course, does not provide much value.  We extend the table with four counting states and four halted states, as shown to the right.  This version of the table also introduces more formal state names, for which these notes  use all capital letters.  The upper four states represent uninterrupted counting, in which  the counter cycles through these states indefinitely.  A user can stop the counter in any state by pressing the ``halt'' button, causing the counter to retain its current value until the user presses the ``go'' button.  Below the state table is an abstract transition diagram, which provides exactly the same information in graphical form.  Here circles represent states (as labeled) and arcs represent transitions from one state to another based on an input combination (which is used to label the arc).  We have already implicitly made a few choices about our counter design.  First, the counter   {c|ccc} state&    no input&  halt button& go button  { COUNT A}& { COUNT B}& { HALT A}&  { COUNT B}& { COUNT C}& { HALT B}&  { COUNT C}& { COUNT D}& { HALT C}&  { COUNT D}& { COUNT A}& { HALT D}&  { HALT A}&  { HALT A}&              & { COUNT B} { HALT B}&  { HALT B}&              & { COUNT C} { HALT C}&  { HALT C}&              & { COUNT D} { HALT D}&  { HALT D}&              & { COUNT A}     shown retains the current state of the system when ``halt'' is pressed. We could instead reset",

    "textbook-paragraph": "implementation of  a specification  implies decisions} about these details, so decisions should only be left  unspecified if any of the possible answers is indeed acceptable.  As a concrete example, let's design logic to control an ice cream  dispenser.  The dispenser has two flavors, lychee and mango, but also allows us to create a blend of the two flavors. For each of the two flavors, our logic must output two bits to control the amount of ice cream that comes out of the dispenser. The two-bit C_L[1:0] output of our logic must specify the number  of half-servings of lychee ice cream as a binary number, and the two-bit C_M[1:0] output must specify the number of  half-servings of mango ice cream.  Thus, for either flavor, 00 indicates none of that flavor, 01 indicates one-half of a serving, and  10 indicates a full serving.  Inputs to our logic will consist of three buttons: an L button to request a serving of lychee ice cream, a B button to request a blend---half a serving of each flavor, and an M button to request a serving of mango ice cream.  Each button produces a 1  when pressed and a 0 when not pressed.    Let's start with the assumption that the user only presses one button at a time.  In this case, we can treat input combinations in which more than one button is pressed as ``don't care'' values in the truth tables for the outputs.  K-maps for all four output bits appear below. The x's indicate ``don't care'' values.    When we calculate the logic function for an output, each ``don't care'' value can be treated as either 0 or 1, whichever is more convenient in terms of creating the logic.  In the case of C_M[1], for  example, we can treat the three x's in the ellipse as 1s, treat the x outside of the ellipse as a 0, and simply use M (the implicant represented by the ellipse) for C_M[1].  The other three output bits are left as an exercise, although the result  appears momentarily.   The implementation at right takes full advantage of the ``don't care'' parts of our specification.  In this case, we require no logic at all; we need merely connect the inputs to the correct outputs.  Let's verify the operation.  We have four cases to consider.  First, if none of the  buttons are pushed (LBM=000), we get no ice cream, as desired (C_M=00  and C_L=00).  Second, if we request lychee ice cream (LBM=100), the outputs are C_L=10 and C_M=00, so we get a full serving of lychee and no mango.  Third, if we request a blend (LBM=010), the outputs are C_L=01 and C_M=01, giving us half a serving of each flavor. Finally, if we request mango ice cream (LBM=001), we get no lychee but a full serving of mango.      The K-maps for this implementation appear below.  Each of the ``don't care'' x's from the original design has been replaced with either a 0 or a 1 and highlighted with shading and green italics. Any implementation produces  either 0 or 1 for every output bit for every possible input combination.  {{file=part2/figs/CLhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CLlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMhigh-basic.eps,width=1.00in}{file=part2/figs/CMlow-basic.eps,width=1.00in}}  As you can see, leveraging ``don't care'' output bits can sometimes significantly simplify our logic.  In the case of this example, we were able to completely eliminate any need for gates!  Unfortunately,  the resulting implementation may sometimes produce unexpected results.   Based on the implementation, what happens if a user presses more than one button?  The ice cream cup overflows!  Let's see why.  Consider the case LBM=101, in which we've pressed both the lychee and mango buttons.  Here C_L=10 and C_M=10, so our dispenser releases a  full serving of each flavor, or two servings total.  Pressing other  combinations may have other repercussions as well. Consider pressing lychee and blend (LBM=110).  The outputs are then C_L=11 and C_M=01.  Hopefully the dispenser simply gives us one and a half servings of lychee and a half serving of mango.",

    "textbook-paragraph": "Notes Set 2.4, for example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares  two bits at a time.  In general, we can optimize logic for any  number of bits and then apply multiple copies of the resulting logic in space (a generalization of the bit-sliced approach), or in time (a generalization of the serialization approach), or in a combination of the two.  Sometimes these tradeoffs may happen at a higher level. As mentioned in Notes Set 2.3, computer software uses  the carry out of an adder to perform addition of larger  groups of bits (over multiple clock cycles) than is supported by the processor's adder hardware.  In computer system design, engineers often design hardware elements that are general enough to support this kind of extension in software.  As a concrete example of the possible tradeoffs, consider a serial comparator design based on the {2-bit} slice variant.  This approach leads to a serial design with 24 gates and 10 inverters,  which is not much larger than our earlier serial design.  In terms of gate delays, however, the new design is identical, meaning that we finish a comparison in half the time.  More realistic area and timing metrics show slightly more difference between the two designs.  These differences can  dominate the  results if we blindly scale the idea to handle more bits without  thinking carefully about the design.  Neither many-input gates nor gates driving many outputs work well in practice.    {Finite State Machines}  A { finite state machine} (or { FSM}) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a finite set of states, moving between these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs.  In any given state, a particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this  combination is called a { transition rule}.  An FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of  possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules, and methods for calculating outputs.    When an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be represented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must be translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.  For a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words, given any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits, a transition must be defined from that state to another state  (transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops},  are acceptable).  And, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces to Boolean logic expressions.  In this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations, in which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.  In this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and analyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next few weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control logic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections between FSMs and software and will make some connections with other areas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital  control systems.  The table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical  keyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the states rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each state---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states. The description of the states in the first column is an optional element often included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying the states needed for the design. A list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in the list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.  By including outputs for each state, we implicitly assume that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail later in these notes (see ``Machine Models''),  but will make the assumption throughout",

    "textbook-paragraph": "Notes Set 2.4, for example, we showed a design for a logic slice that compares  two bits at a time.  In general, we can optimize logic for any  number of bits and then apply multiple copies of the resulting logic in space (a generalization of the bit-sliced approach), or in time (a generalization of the serialization approach), or in a combination of the two.  Sometimes these tradeoffs may happen at a higher level. As mentioned in Notes Set 2.3, computer software uses  the carry out of an adder to perform addition of larger  groups of bits (over multiple clock cycles) than is supported by the processor's adder hardware.  In computer system design, engineers often design hardware elements that are general enough to support this kind of extension in software.  As a concrete example of the possible tradeoffs, consider a serial comparator design based on the {2-bit} slice variant.  This approach leads to a serial design with 24 gates and 10 inverters,  which is not much larger than our earlier serial design.  In terms of gate delays, however, the new design is identical, meaning that we finish a comparison in half the time.  More realistic area and timing metrics show slightly more difference between the two designs.  These differences can  dominate the  results if we blindly scale the idea to handle more bits without  thinking carefully about the design.  Neither many-input gates nor gates driving many outputs work well in practice.    {Finite State Machines}  A { finite state machine} (or { FSM}) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a finite set of states, moving between these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs.  In any given state, a particular input may cause the FSM to move to another state; this  combination is called a { transition rule}.  An FSM comprises five parts: a finite set of states, a set of  possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, a set of transition rules, and methods for calculating outputs.    When an FSM is implemented as a digital system, all states must be represented as patterns using a fixed number of bits, all inputs must be translated into bits, and all outputs must be translated into bits.  For a digital FSM, transition rules must be { complete}; in other words, given any state of the FSM, and any pattern of input bits, a transition must be defined from that state to another state  (transitions from a state to itself, called { self-loops},  are acceptable).  And, of course, calculation of outputs for a digital FSM reduces to Boolean logic expressions.  In this class, we focus on clocked synchronous FSM implementations, in which the FSM's internal state bits are stored in flip-flops.  In this section, we introduce the tools used to describe, develop, and analyze implementations of FSMs with digital logic.  In the next few weeks, we will show you how an FSM can serve as the central control logic in a computer.  At the same time, we will illustrate connections between FSMs and software and will make some connections with other areas of interest in ECE, such as the design and analysis of digital  control systems.  The table below gives a { list of abstract states} for a typical  keyless entry system for a car.  In this case, we have merely named the states rather than specifying the bit patterns to be used for each state---for this reason, we refer to them as abstract states. The description of the states in the first column is an optional element often included in the early design stages for an FSM, when identifying the states needed for the design. A list may also include the outputs for each state.  Again, in the list below, we have specified these outputs abstractly.  By including outputs for each state, we implicitly assume that outputs depend only on the state of the FSM.  We discuss this assumption in more detail later in these notes (see ``Machine Models''),  but will make the assumption throughout",

The two levels refer simply to the number of functions through which an input passes to reach an output, and both the SOP and POS forms are  examples of two-level logic.  In this section, we illustrate one of the  reasons for this popularity and  show you how to graphically manipulate expressions, which can sometimes help when trying to understand gate diagrams.  We begin with one of DeMorgan's laws, which we can illustrate both  algebraically and graphically: C  =  B+A  =      {file=part2/figs/demorgan-nand.eps,width=0.95in}     Let's say that we have a function expressed in SOP form, such as Z=ABC+DE+FGHJ.  The diagram on the left below shows the function constructed from three AND gates and an OR gate.  Using DeMorgan's law, we can replace the OR gate with a NAND with inverted inputs. But the bubbles that correspond to inversion do not need to sit at the input to the gate.  We can invert at any point along the wire, so we slide each bubble down the wire to the output of the first column of AND gates.  { Be careful: if the wire splits, which does not happen in our example, you have to replicate the inverter onto the other output paths as you slide past the split point!}  The end result is shown on the right: we have not changed the  function, but now we use only NAND gates.  Since CMOS technology only supports NAND and NOR directly, using two-level logic makes it simple to map our expression into CMOS gates.  {file=part2/figs/SOP-equiv.eps,width=6.5in}   You may want to make use of DeMorgan's other law, illustrated graphically to the right, to perform the same transformation on a POS expression.  What do you get?   {file=part2/figs/demorgan-nor.eps,width=0.95in}    {Multi-Metric Optimization}  As engineers, almost every real problem that you encounter will admit  multiple metrics for evaluating possible designs.  Becoming a good engineer thus requires not only that you be able to solve problems creatively so as to improve the quality of your solutions, but also that you are aware of how people might evaluate those solutions and are able both to identify the most important metrics and to balance  your design effectively according to them.  In this section, we introduce some general ideas and methods that may be of use to you in this regard.  { We will not test you on the concepts in this section.}  When you start thinking about a new problem, your first step should be to think carefully about metrics of possible interest.  Some important metrics may not be easy to quantify.    For example, compatibility of a design with other products already  owned by a customer has frequently defined the success or failure of computer hardware and software solutions.  But how can you compute the compability of your approach as a number?  Humans---including engineers---are not good at comparing multiple metrics simultaneously.  Thus, once you have a set of metrics that you feel is complete,  your next step is to get rid of as many as you can.  Towards this end, you may identify metrics that have no practical  impact in current technology, set threshold values for other metrics to simplify reasoning about them, eliminate redundant metrics, calculate linear sums to reduce the count of metrics, and, finally, make use of the notion of Pareto optimality.  All of these ideas are described in the rest of this section.  Let's start by considering metrics that we can quantify as real numbers.  For a given metric, we can divide possible measurement values into three ranges.  In the first range, all measurement values are equivalently useful. In the second range,  possible values are ordered and interesting with respect to one another. Values in the third range are all impossible to use in practice.

Let's start with the case in which both operands are negative, so A<0 and B<0, and thus the real sum C<0 as well.  Given that A and B are represented as {N-bit} 2's complement, they must fall in the representable range, so we can write  {eqnarray*} -2^{N-1}  & A & < 0 -2^{N-1}  & B & < 0 {eqnarray*}  We add these two inequalities and replace A+B with C to obtain  {eqnarray*} -2^N  & C & < 0 {eqnarray*}  Given that an overflow has occurred, C must fall outside of the  representable range.  Given that C<0, it cannot be larger than the largest possible number representable using {N-bit} 2's complement, so we can write  {eqnarray*} -2^N  & C & < -2^{N-1} {eqnarray*}  We now add 2^N to each part to obtain  {eqnarray*} 0  & C + 2^N & < 2^{N-1} {eqnarray*}  This range of integers falls within the representable range  for {N-bit} 2's complement, so we can replace the middle expression with S (equal to C modulo 2^N) to find that  {eqnarray*} 0  & S & < 2^{N-1} {eqnarray*}  Thus, if we have an overflow and both A<0 and B<0, the resulting sum S, and condition 1 holds.  The proof for the case in which we observe an overflow when  both operands are non-negative (A and B) is similar, and leads to condition 2.  We again begin with inequalities for A and B:  {eqnarray*} 0  & A & < 2^{N-1} 0  & B & < 2^{N-1} {eqnarray*}  We add these two inequalities and replace A+B with C to obtain  {eqnarray*} 0  & C < & 2^N {eqnarray*}  Given that an overflow has occurred, C must fall outside of the  representable range.  Given that C{}0, it cannot be smaller than the smallest possible number representable using {N-bit} 2's complement, so we can write  {eqnarray*} 2^{N-1}  & C & < 2^N {eqnarray*}  We now subtract 2^N to each part to obtain  {eqnarray*} -2^{N-1}  & C - 2^N & < 0 {eqnarray*}  This range of integers falls within the representable range  for {N-bit} 2's complement, so we can replace the middle expression with S (equal to C modulo 2^N) to find that  {eqnarray*} -2^{N-1}  & S & < 0 {eqnarray*}  Thus, if we have an overflow and both A and B, the resulting sum S<0, and condition 2 holds.

    "textbook-paragraph": "if a chip finishes its work, the chip can turn itself off, saving energy.  How do such high-level metrics relate to the problem at hand?  Only indirectly in practice.  There are too many factors involved to make direct calculations of cost, power, or performance at the level of logic expressions.    Finding an { optimal} solution---the best formulation of a specific logic function for a given metric---is often impossible using the  computational resources and algorithms available to us.  Instead, tools typically use heuristic approaches to find solutions that strike a balance between these metrics. A { heuristic} approach is one that is believed to yield fairly good solutions to a problem, but does not necessarily find an optimal solution.  A human engineer can typically impose { constraints}, such as limits on the chip area or limits on the minimum performance, in order to guide the process.  Human engineers may also restructure the implementation of a  larger design, such as a design to perform floating-point arithmetic, so as to change the logic functions used in the design.  { Today, manipulation of logic expressions for the purposes of  optimization is performed almost entirely by computers.}  Humans must supply the logic functions of interest, and must program the acceptable  transformations between equivalent forms, but computers do the grunt work of comparing alternative formulations and deciding which one is best to use in context.  Although we believe that hand optimization of Boolean expressions is no longer an important skill for our graduates, we do think that you should be exposed to the ideas and metrics historically used for such optimization.  The rationale for retaining this exposure is  threefold.   First, we believe that you still need to be able to perform basic logic reformulations (slowly is acceptable) and logical equivalence checking (answering the question, ``Do two  expressions represent the same function?'').  Second, the complexity of the problem is a good way to introduce you to real engineering.  Finally, the contextual information will help you to develop a better understanding of finite state machines and higher-level abstractions that form the core of digital systems and are still defined directly by humans today.  Towards that end, we conclude this introduction by discussing two metrics that engineers traditionally used to optimize  logic expressions.  These metrics are now embedded in { computer-aided  design} ({ CAD}) tools and tuned to specific underlying technologies, but the reasons for their use are still interesting.  The first metric of interest is a heuristic for the area needed for a design.  The measurement is simple: count the number of variable occurrences in an expression.  Simply go through and add up how many variables you see. Using our example function C,  Equation () gives a count of 6, Equation () gives a count of 8, and Equation () gives a count of 24. Smaller numbers represent better expressions, so  Equation () is the best choice by this metric.  Why is this metric interesting? Recall how gates are built from transistors. An {N-input} gate requires roughly 2N transistors, so if you  count up the number of variables in the expression, you get an estimate of the number of transistors needed, which is in turn an estimate for the area required for the design.  A variation on variable counting is to add the number of operations, since each gate also takes space for wiring (within as well as between gates).  Note that we ignore the number of inputs to the operations, so a {2-input} AND counts as 1, but a {10-input} AND also counts as 1.  We do not usually count complementing variables as an operation for this metric because the complements of variables are sometimes  available at no extra cost in gates or wires.  If we add the number of operations in our example, we get a count of 10 for Equation ()---two ANDs, two ORs, and 6 variables,  a count of 12 for Equation ()---three",
