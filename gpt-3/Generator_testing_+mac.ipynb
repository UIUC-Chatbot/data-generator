Finally, we illustrate how the choice of representation\\nfor the FSM's internal state affects the complexity of the implementation.\\nFortunately, designs that are more intuitive and easier for humans to\\nunderstand also typically make the best designs in terms of \\nother metrics, such as logic complexity.\\n\\n\\n\""

       "\"{An Abstract Model}\\n\\n\\nWe start by writing down states for a user's expected behavior.\\nGiven the fairly tight constraints that we have placed on our lab,\\nfew combinations are pos-\\n\\n\\n{c|cc|cc}\\nstate& dime (T=0)& quarter (T=1)& accept? (A)& paid? (P) \\nSTART& DIME& QUARTER& & no\\nDIME& & PAID& yes& no\\nQUARTER& PAID& & yes& no\\nPAID& & & yes& yes\\n\\n\\n\\nsible.  For a total of 35 cents, a user should either insert a dime \\nfollowed by a quarter, or a quarter followed by a dime.\\n\\nWe begin in a START state, which transitions to states DIME or QUARTER\\nwhen the user inserts the first coin.  With no previous coin, we need not\\nspecify a value for A.  No money has been deposited, so we set \\noutput P=0 in the START state.\\n\\nWe next create DIME and QUARTER states corresponding to the user having\\nentered one coin.  The first coin should be accepted, but more money is\\nneeded, so both of these states output A=1 and P=0.\\nWhen a coin of the opposite type is entered, each state moves to a\\nstate called PAID, which we use for the case in which a total of 35 cents has\\nbeen received.  For now, we ignore the possibility that the same type\\nof coin is deposited more than once.  Finally, the PAID state accepts\\nthe second coin (A=1) and indicates that the user has paid the full\\nprice of 35 cents (P=1).\\n\\n\\nWe next extend our design to handle user mistakes.  If a user enters\\na second dime in the DIME state, our FSM should reject the coin.  We\\ncreate a REJECTD state and add it as the next state from\\n\\n\\n{c|cc|cc}\\nstate& dime (T=0)& quarter (T=1)& accept? (A)& paid? (P) \\nSTART& DIME& QUARTER& & no\\nDIME& REJECTD& PAID& yes& no\\nREJECTD& REJECTD& PAID& no& no\\nQUARTER& PAID& REJECTQ& yes& no\\nREJECTQ& PAID& REJECTQ& no& no\\nPAID& & & yes& yes\\n\\n\\n\\nDIME when a dime is entered.\\nThe REJECTD state rejects the dime (A=0) and\\ncontinues to wait for a quarter (P=0).  What should we use as next \\nstates from REJECTD?  If the user enters a third dime (or a fourth, \\nor a fifth, and so on), we want to reject the new dime as well.  \\nIf the user enters a quarter, we want to accept the coin, at which point\\nwe have received 35 cents (counting the first dime).  We use\\nthis reasoning to complete the description of REJECTD.  We also create\\nan analogous state, REJECTQ, to handle a user who inserts more than\\none quarter.\\n\\nWhat should happen after a user has paid 35 cents and bought \\none item?  The FSM at that point is in the PAID state, which delivers\\nthe item by setting P=1.\\n\\nGiven that we want the FSM to allow the user to purchase another item, \\nhow should we choose the next states from PAID?\\n\\nThe behavior that we want from PAID is identical to the behavior that\\nwe defined from START.  The 35 cents already \\ndeposited was used to pay for the item delivered, so the machine is\\nno longer holding any of the user's money.\\n\\nWe can thus simply set the next states from PAID to be DIME when a \\ndime is inserted and QUARTER when a quarter is inserted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point, we make a decision intended primarily to simplify the\\nlogic needed to build the lab.  Without a physical item delivery \\nmechanism with a specification for how its in-\\n\\n\\n{c|cc|cc}\\nstate& dime (T=0)& quarter (T=1)& accept? (A)& paid? (P) \\nPAID& DIME& QUARTER& yes& yes\\nDIME& REJECTD& PAID& yes& no\\nREJECTD& REJECTD& PAID& no& no\\nQUARTER& PAID& REJECTQ& yes& no\\nREJECTQ& PAID& REJECTQ& no& no\\n\\n\\n\\nput must be driven, \\nthe behavior of the output signal P can be fairly flexible.  \\nFor example, we could build a delivery mechanism that used the rising\\nedge of P to open a chute.  In this case, the output P=0 in the\\nstart state is not relevant, and we can merge the state START with\\nthe state PAID.  The way that we handle P in the lab, we might\\nfind it strange to have a ``paid'' light turn on before inserting any\\nmoney, but keeping the design simple enough for a first lab exercise \\nis more important.  Our final abstract state table appears above.\\n\\n\""
