The design of a finite state machine differs from that of a counter in a few ways. For one, a finite state machine has a finite number of states that it can be in, while a counter can have an infinite number of states. Additionally, a finite state machine's output is determined by its current state, while a counter's output is determined by its current state and the inputs it receives.

Q. What are some of the reasons that RISC machines were viewed as the proper design for future ISAs?","

A. RISC machines were viewed as the proper design for future ISAs because they employed fixed-length instructions and a load-store architecture, which allowed only a few addressing modes and small offsets.

A. If the system needs to represent a different digit, the pattern with no errors will still have exactly two 1s. If a bit error occurs, the resulting error pattern will have either one 1 or three 1s, which will not have a meaning in the 2-out-of-5 code. So this representation will still enable the digital system to detect any single bit error.",0.4802089035511017
